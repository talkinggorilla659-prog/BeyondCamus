# Chapter 10: Naturalism About Normativity

Pragmatic existentialism requires defensible metaethics. This chapter develops naturalism about normativity: values are real features of natural world (not transcendent) yet genuinely normative (not reducible to descriptive facts). This seemingly paradoxical position is coherent and avoids both error theory (there are no values) and non-naturalism (values are transcendent).

## 10.1 The Metaethical Question

Metaethics asks: What is the nature of moral and normative claims? When I say "torture is wrong" or "I ought to keep promises," what am I asserting?

**Realism**: Moral facts exist independent of human attitudes. Murder is wrong regardless of what anyone thinks.

**Anti-realism**: No mind-independent moral facts exist. Moral claims express attitudes, prescribe actions, or project feelings onto world.

**Non-naturalism**: Moral facts exist but are not natural facts. They are sui generis, knowable through intuition or reason.

**Naturalism**: Moral facts are natural facts—but there is disagreement about what this means.

## 10.2 The Challenge for Naturalism

### 10.2.1 The Open Question Argument

G.E. Moore argued that moral properties cannot be identical to natural properties because of the "open question" (*Principia Ethica*, §13). For any natural property N, we can coherently ask: "X has N, but is X good?" This question is open—not answered by definition.

Example: "Pleasure is good." We can coherently ask: "Is pleasure really good?" If "good" meant "pleasurable," this would be like asking "Is pleasure really pleasurable?"—which is closed question, answered by definition.

Therefore, "good" cannot mean any natural property. If moral realism is true, moral properties must be non-natural.

### 10.2.2 The Normativity Problem

Naturalism seems to collapse normativity into description. If "ought" just means some natural fact, it loses normative force. Natural facts describe what is; norms prescribe what should be. How can description become prescription?

### 10.2.3 The Motivation Problem

Moral judgments seem inherently motivating. If I genuinely judge "I ought to help," I am motivated to help (absent weakness of will). But natural facts are not inherently motivating. Learning that X is the case doesn't automatically motivate me to do anything. How can naturalism explain moral judgment's motivational force?

## 10.3 Varieties of Naturalism

### 10.3.1 Analytic Naturalism

Attempt to define moral terms using natural terms. "Good = produces happiness" or "Right = maximizes utility."

This fails for reasons Moore identified. Moral terms cannot be analytically reduced to natural terms without changing meaning.

### 10.3.2 Synthetic Naturalism

Moral properties are identical to natural properties, but not analytically. The identity is discovered empirically, like "Water = H2O."

Example (Richard Boyd): "Good = contributes to human flourishing" is synthetic identity discovered through moral inquiry, not analytic definition.

Problem: How do we discover moral identities? Scientific identities are confirmed by empirical evidence. What confirms moral identities? Seems circular—we identify good with flourishing because we already believe flourishing is good.

### 10.3.3 Non-Reductive Naturalism

Moral properties supervene on natural properties (no moral difference without natural difference) but are not reducible to them. Moral facts are natural facts but require distinctively normative concepts to describe.

This is closer to the position I defend, but needs clarification.

## 10.4 The Pragmatic Naturalist Position

### 10.4.1 The Starting Point

Begin not with abstract metaethics but with phenomenon to explain: we are natural creatures (biological organisms subject to natural law) who nonetheless experience normative demands (oughts, obligations, reasons).

The question is not "Do objective moral facts exist in Platonic realm?" but "How do normative phenomena arise within natural world?"

### 10.4.2 Normativity and Agency

Normativity emerges with agency. Non-agents (rocks, plants) are not subject to norms. They have causal properties but no obligations. Organisms capable of acting on reasons (rational agents) are subject to norms.

This is not mystery requiring transcendent explanation. It is natural fact about certain kinds of organisms. Just as photosynthesis emerges at certain level of biological complexity, normativity emerges at certain level of cognitive sophistication.

### 10.4.3 The Constitutive Account

Following Korsgaard, I argue that normativity is constitutive of rational agency. To be rational agent is to be bound by norms—norms of coherence, consistency, recognition of others, etc.

These norms are not imposed from outside (transcendent realm) or arbitrarily chosen (voluntarism). They are structural features of what it means to be rational agent.

Analogy: To play chess is to be bound by chess rules. The rules are not transcendent facts or arbitrary choices. They constitute what chess is. Similarly, to be rational agent is to be bound by norms constitutive of rational agency.

### 10.4.4 Why This Is Naturalism

This account is naturalistic because:
1. **Agents are natural organisms**: Humans are biological creatures evolved through natural selection
2. **Rationality is natural capacity**: Product of evolution, realized in neural structures
3. **Norms emerge from natural facts**: The fact that we are rational agents (natural fact) generates normative constraints

There is no appeal to transcendent realm, Platonic forms, or supernatural entities. Normativity is natural phenomenon arising at certain level of organizational complexity.

### 10.4.5 Why This Preserves Normativity

This account is genuinely normative because:
1. **Oughts constrain action**: I cannot coherently claim to be rational agent while violating constitutive norms
2. **Reasons provide justification**: Explanations appealing to agency's constitutive structure justify actions
3. **Values bind**: Not because cosmos validates them but because they constitute what I am as agent

The normativity is real even if not transcendent. Compare: chess rules really bind chess players, even though they are not transcendent facts. The binding comes from constitutive role, not metaphysical status.

## 10.5 Responding to Objections

### 10.5.1 "This Makes Morality Optional"

Objection: If norms are constitutive of agency, I can escape them by ceasing to be agent. This makes morality optional.

Response: This objection is incoherent. To deliberate about whether to be agent is already to be agent. I cannot step outside agency to evaluate it from neutral standpoint.

Moreover, "ceasing to be agent" is not trivial option. It requires undermining one's own rational capacities—self-lobotomy or death. These are possible but not "options" in relevant sense. I am stuck being agent so long as I deliberate at all.

### 10.5.2 "This Is Circular"

Objection: You define normativity in terms of agency, then define agency in terms of normativity. This is circular.

Response: Not vicious circle but conceptual interdependence. Agency and normativity are co-constituting. Neither can be fully understood without the other, but this doesn't make explanation circular.

Analogy: "Meaning" and "language" are co-constituting. Words have meaning because they function in language. Language functions because words have meaning. This is not vicious circle but accurate description of interdependent phenomena.

### 10.5.3 "This Doesn't Explain Why I Should Care"

Objection: Even if norms are constitutive of agency, why should I care about being coherent agent? Maybe I prefer incoherence.

Response: This question is self-undermining. "Why should I care?" is demand for reasons. Making this demand presupposes you are engaged in rational deliberation—i.e., constituted as agent responsive to reasons. You cannot coherently ask for reasons while refusing to be reason-responsive.

### 10.5.4 "This Is Just Kant Repackaged"

Objection: You're deriving morality from practical reason, which is what Kant did. Nothing new here.

Response: Important differences:
- **Kant**: Categorical imperative is synthetic a priori truth binding all rational beings universally
- **This view**: Norms emerge from practical identities, which vary situationally

- **Kant**: Morality is purely formal, independent of consequences
- **This view**: Pragmatist testing by consequences is essential

- **Kant**: Noumenal self transcends empirical nature
- **This view**: Agency is natural phenomenon arising in evolved organisms

The resemblance is real (both ground normativity in practical reason), but substantial differences remain.

### 10.5.5 "This Makes Morality Relative"

Objection: If norms emerge from practical identities that vary by individual and culture, this is relativism.

Response: Not pure relativism because:
1. Not all practical identities are coherent (self-undermining ones are ruled out)
2. Recognition of others' agency constrains identities universally
3. Pragmatic testing constrains which identities are sustainable
4. Social deliberation refines values over time

There is more universality than pure relativism, less than Kantian absolutism. Call it "constrained pluralism."

## 10.6 The Is-Ought Gap Reconsidered

The most fundamental metaethical challenge is Hume's is-ought gap: no set of purely descriptive premises can entail normative conclusions. This threatens any naturalist ethics, including the framework I've developed.

In Chapter 12 (§12.7), I claimed to "dissolve" rather than bridge the gap. This requires more careful examination. The honest assessment is: I don't dissolve the gap—I show why it's less problematic than it appears and why my approach handles it better than alternatives.

### 10.6.1 What the Gap Actually Is

Hume observed (*Treatise*, 3.1.1): Authors move from "is" statements (describing what exists) to "ought" statements (prescribing what should be) without explaining the transition. The logical point: descriptive premises alone never entail normative conclusions.

**Example**:
- **Premise**: Humans flourish when recognized as agents
- **Premise**: Recognition requires treating all persons as having equal moral status
- **Conclusion**: Therefore, we ought to recognize all persons as having equal moral status

The conclusion doesn't follow logically. The premises describe facts about flourishing and recognition, but don't establish that we *ought* to value flourishing or recognition.

This is the gap. Any naturalist ethics must cross it somehow—or show why crossing it isn't necessary.

### 10.6.2 Why "Dissolving" Was Too Strong

In Chapter 12, I argued the gap is pseudo-problem arising from demanding external justification for practical reasoning itself. I claimed that agency inherently involves oughts, so asking "why be responsive to oughts?" is incoherent.

This was too quick. The sophisticated critic (like Richard Joyce in *The Evolution of Morality*) responds:

"Yes, practical reasoning involves treating some considerations as normatively binding. But maybe this is just useful fiction—psychological disposition that evolved because it promotes cooperation, not because genuine normative truths exist. The is-ought gap shows that no natural facts (including facts about agency) generate real oughts. They only generate feelings-as-if there are oughts."

This is error theory: moral claims purport to describe objective normative facts, but no such facts exist. All moral claims are systematically false (or non-cognitive).

I cannot simply dissolve the is-ought gap by pointing to agency's structure. I must either:
1. Show how normative facts arise within natural world (ambitious)
2. Defend why practically binding norms are sufficient even if not metaphysically ultimate (modest)

I opt for (2).

### 10.6.3 The Honest Response: Pragmatic Bridging

I don't derive oughts from ises. Instead, I start from the standpoint of practical deliberation—which already involves oughts—and show that certain normative commitments are inescapable *from that standpoint*.

**The structure**:

**Step 1**: Recognize we're always already engaged in practical reasoning. Even the error theorist asking "Why care about norms?" is asking for normative guidance.

**Step 2**: Show that practical reasoning has internal structure involving oughts. To deliberate at all requires treating some considerations as normatively binding (even if provisional).

**Step 3**: Demonstrate that certain norms are constitutive of practical reasoning itself—you can't deliberate coherently while violating them.

**Step 4**: Add pragmatic testing: norms that enable sustainable agency and flourishing are superior to those that don't (this is empirical claim).

**The result**: Oughts emerge not by deriving from ises but by recognizing them as internal to the practice of practical reasoning + testing which oughts work.

This *is* a form of bridging the gap—but pragmatic rather than logical bridging. I'm not deducing oughts from ises; I'm showing that oughts are inescapable features of situated practical reasoning and then testing which oughts are most defensible.

### 10.6.4 Why This Isn't Circular

Objection: "You start with normative practice (agency) to ground normativity. Isn't that circular?"

Response: It's not vicious circle for three reasons:

**First—Reflective equilibrium**: I'm not deducing from fixed starting point. I'm showing mutual support among:
- Phenomenology of practical deliberation
- Structure of rational agency
- Pragmatic consequences of different normative frameworks
- Social sustainability of practices

Each element supports others. This is circular but non-viciously so—it's how all justification works for finite beings.

**Second—Pragmatic test**: The framework is tested by whether it enables flourishing. If following these norms produced systematic suffering or undermined agency, that would be evidence against the framework. The test is external to the theory.

**Third—Comparison to alternatives**: Every metaethical view must start somewhere. The question is which starting point is most defensible:
- Realism starts: "Objective moral facts exist" (metaphysically extravagant)
- Expressivism starts: "Moral claims express attitudes" (can't explain moral reasoning)
- Error theory starts: "No moral facts exist" (unlivable)
- This view starts: "We deliberate practically" (phenomenologically obvious)

Starting from practical deliberation is least question-begging because it's the actual standpoint from which all these debates occur.

### 10.6.5 Comparing Bridges: Why Mine vs. Kierkegaard's Leap?

In Chapter 12, I distinguished my "leap" (to recognition, flourishing, agency) from Kierkegaard's leap to God. Critics will press: what's the difference?

**The differences**:

**1. Epistemic status**:
- **Kierkegaard**: Leaps *against* reason to embrace absurdity ("by virtue of the absurd")
- **My bridge**: Operates *within* reason, showing practical commitments from standpoint of deliberation

**2. Revisability**:
- **Kierkegaard**: Faith requires permanent commitment against doubt
- **My bridge**: Fallibilist—all claims revisable in light of experience

**3. Practical testing**:
- **Kierkegaard**: Cannot test whether God exists by consequences
- **My bridge**: Can test whether recognizing others' agency enables flourishing

**4. Intersubjective agreement**:
- **Kierkegaard**: Faith is radically individual ("knight of faith")
- **My bridge**: Norms are socially tested and refined through collective deliberation

**5. Metaphysical modesty**:
- **Kierkegaard**: Posits transcendent divine reality
- **My bridge**: Makes no claims beyond natural world

So while both involve commitments that can't be proven from neutral standpoint, mine remains within practical reasoning and is empirically testable while his abandons reason for faith.

### 10.6.6 Engaging Joyce's Error Theory

Richard Joyce argues (*The Evolution of Morality*, 2006) that moral norms evolved as useful fictions promoting cooperation. They *feel* binding but aren't genuinely normative. The is-ought gap shows this: no natural facts (including evolutionary facts) generate real oughts.

**My response**:

**Concession**: Joyce is right that oughts don't flow from natural facts by logical entailment. Evolution explains why we *experience* things as normatively binding, but doesn't *justify* treating them as binding.

**But**: This creates practical problem. We are creatures who must deliberate about what to do. Even Joyce, as error theorist, must decide how to act. The question is: which framework for deliberation is most defensible?

**Options**:
1. **Nihilism**: Recognize no oughts are real, act on mere preferences
2. **Fictionalism** (Joyce's view): Treat norms as useful fictions
3. **Constructivism**: Recognize oughts as internal to practical reasoning

**Against nihilism**: Psychologically impossible to sustain. Even Joyce doesn't live this way. He acts on reasons, makes commitments, feels obligations.

**Against fictionalism**: Unstable middle position. If I know norms are fictions, they lose their action-guiding force. Joyce must either:
- Deceive himself (believe norms while "knowing" they're fictions—bad faith)
- Maintain conscious double-consciousness (exhausting and unclear if sustainable)

**For constructivism**: Norms don't need to be cosmically real to be practically binding. They're real *within the practice of practical reasoning*—and that's the only standpoint from which the question matters.

**The key point**: Joyce wants norms to be "objective" in sense of existing independent of our practices. When he shows they don't exist this way, he concludes they're fictions. But this assumes the wrong standard. Norms don't need cosmic objectivity; they need practical authority within deliberation.

My framework provides this without requiring metaphysically spooky entities.

### 10.6.7 The Modest Conclusion

I make no claim to have solved the is-ought problem definitively. Instead:

**What I've shown**:
1. Practical reasoning inherently involves normative commitments
2. Some norms are constitutive of rational agency
3. Norms can be tested pragmatically by consequences
4. This provides sufficient normativity for living well
5. It's more defensible than alternatives

**What I haven't shown**:
1. That oughts exist independent of practical reasoning
2. That someone who opts out of practical reasoning is making logical error
3. That my starting point is uniquely self-evident or unrevisable

**The honest position**: Every metaethical view faces grounding problems. Realism can't explain how we access non-natural facts. Expressivism can't explain moral disagreement or reasoning. Error theory can't be lived. Constructivism can't provide external justification for valuing rationality.

But constructivism + pragmatism handles its grounding problems better than alternatives. It's phenomenologically accurate, metaphysically modest, epistemically tractable, and practically usable.

The is-ought gap remains. But I've shown why crossing it pragmatically is sufficient for ethical life—and superior to alternatives that either deny the gap exists (crude naturalism) or refuse to cross it at all (error theory).

## 10.7 The Pragmatist Addition

Korsgaard's constitutive account is powerful but incomplete. I add pragmatist element: values are tested empirically by their consequences.

### 10.6.1 Moral Epistemology

We discover which norms are genuinely binding through experience. Some practical identities we thought coherent turn out self-undermining. Some values we thought sustainable produce suffering. Some social practices we thought beneficial are actually oppressive.

This is empirical inquiry, not a priori deduction. We learn about normativity through living, not pure reason.

### 10.6.2 Fallibilism

All normative claims are revisable in light of experience. Even seemingly fundamental commitments (honesty, care, justice) may need specification or revision in some contexts.

This fallibilism is feature, not bug. It reflects honest acknowledgment of human finitude and epistemic limitation.

### 10.6.3 Social Inquiry

We test values collectively. Individual agents can be mistaken about what norms truly bind them. Through social deliberation—comparing experiences, criticizing each other's reasoning, observing consequences—we refine understanding of normativity.

This is not "morality is whatever society says" (crude relativism). It is "we discover moral truths through collective inquiry" (social epistemology).

### 10.6.4 Progress

This framework allows for moral progress. Societies learn over time which practices sustain agency and flourishing, which undermine them. This explains historical developments (abolition of slavery, women's rights, LGBTQ inclusion) without requiring that norms were always already true but unrecognized.

## 10.7 The Ontological Status of Values

What are values, metaphysically speaking?

### 10.7.1 Not Platonic Forms

Values are not abstract entities existing independently of natural world. No realm of transcendent values.

### 10.7.2 Not Mere Attitudes

Values are not simply subjective preferences or emotions. When I judge torture wrong, I'm not merely expressing distaste.

### 10.7.3 Response-Dependent Properties

Values are response-dependent: they exist in relation to agents with particular constitutions. "Good" is like "delicious"—not purely subjective (not mere preference) but not fully objective either (depends on tasters).

But response-dependence doesn't make values arbitrary. Just as "delicious" depends on human taste apparatus that is not arbitrary (evolved, shared), "good" depends on human agency structure that is not arbitrary (constitutive, recognizable).

### 10.7.4 Natural But Non-Reducible

Values are natural properties (they arise in natural world, involve natural organisms) but not reducible to non-normative natural properties. Moral language cannot be eliminated in favor of purely descriptive language without loss.

This is non-reductive naturalism. Values supervene on natural facts (no moral difference without natural difference) but require normative concepts to describe.

## 10.8 Defining Human Flourishing

Throughout this book, I've tested practical identities and values by whether they enable "human flourishing" or "agency." But what do these terms mean? This vagueness is serious problem. Without specifying flourishing, pragmatic testing becomes circular: we test values by flourishing, but flourishing is defined by values we already accept.

This section provides precise account of flourishing while acknowledging its contested nature.

### 10.8.1 Why Flourishing Needs Definition

The framework relies on claims like:
- "Practical identities are tested by consequences for flourishing" (Chapter 5)
- "Hierarchical systems fail because they undermine flourishing" (Chapter 6)
- "The Nazi identity produces suffering rather than flourishing" (Chapter 5)

But these claims are empty unless we specify what flourishing means. Is flourishing:
- **Hedonic**: Maximum pleasure, minimum pain? (Bentham)
- **Preference satisfaction**: Getting what you want? (Economics)
- **Perfectionist**: Realizing human excellence? (Aristotle)
- **Capabilities**: Having freedom to achieve valued functionings? (Sen/Nussbaum)

Different conceptions give radically different results. The ascetic monk doesn't flourish hedonically but may flourish perfectionist-ly. The wealthy but anxious executive satisfies preferences but lacks wellbeing.

Without specification, I can't genuinely test values—I'm just projecting my own conception of good life onto "flourishing."

### 10.8.2 The Capabilities Approach

I adopt modified version of Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum's capabilities approach (*Development as Freedom*; *Creating Capabilities*).

**Core idea**: Flourishing consists in having genuine freedom (capability) to achieve valuable functionings (ways of being and doing).

**Why this approach**:
1. Respects agency (focuses on freedom to choose, not just outcomes)
2. Allows pluralism (people can realize capabilities differently)
3. Empirically tractable (we can measure whether people have capabilities)
4. Cross-culturally defensible (capabilities are broad enough to accommodate variation)

### 10.8.3 The List of Central Capabilities

Drawing on Nussbaum (*Creating Capabilities*, 33-34) with modifications:

**1. Life**: Being able to live a normal human lifespan; not dying prematurely
- Health, nutrition, clean water, safety from violence

**2. Bodily health**: Being able to have good health, including reproductive health
- Access to healthcare, adequate nutrition, shelter

**3. Bodily integrity**: Being able to move freely, be secure against assault (including sexual assault)
- Freedom from violence, security of person, bodily autonomy

**4. Senses, imagination, thought**: Being able to use senses, imagine, think, and reason
- Education, freedom of expression, access to information, cultural participation

**5. Emotions**: Being able to have attachments; love, grieve, experience joy
- Emotional development not blighted by fear or anxiety
- Supportive relationships and social bonds

**6. Practical reason**: Being able to form conception of good and plan one's life
- This is agency itself—the capacity for self-governance
- Freedom to deliberate and make meaningful choices

**7. Affiliation**: Being able to live with and toward others, engage socially
- Recognition as person with equal dignity
- Social bases of self-respect
- Ability to participate in relationships and community

**8. Other species**: Being able to live with concern for animals, plants, nature
- Connection to natural world

**9. Play**: Being able to laugh, play, enjoy recreational activities
- Leisure, rest, creative expression

**10. Control over environment**:
- **Political**: Participate in decisions affecting one's life, have voice in governance
- **Material**: Hold property, work on equal terms, have economic security

### 10.8.4 How This List Addresses Circularity

This list is **not derived from my ethical framework**. It's grounded in:

**1. Anthropological observation**: These capabilities are valued across diverse cultures. While specific realizations vary, the general categories appear cross-culturally.

**2. Empirical connection to wellbeing**: When people lack these capabilities, they report suffering and dissatisfaction. When they possess them, wellbeing increases.

**3. Evolutionary grounding**: These capabilities relate to human needs that evolved over millions of years—social connection, autonomy, health, knowledge.

**4. Reflective endorsement**: When people are asked to deliberate about what constitutes good life, these capabilities consistently emerge.

So I'm not defining flourishing by my preferred values and then using "flourishing" to test values. The list has independent justification.

### 10.8.5 How to Use the List

The list provides criteria for evaluating practical identities and social practices:

**A practical identity is problematic if it**:
- Systematically undermines any central capability for the agent
- Systematically undermines capabilities for others
- Requires false beliefs to maintain
- Cannot be sustained through changing circumstances

**Examples**:

**The Nazi identity**:
- Undermines capabilities for victims (life, bodily integrity, affiliation, political participation)
- Requires false beliefs (racial hierarchy)
- Cannot be sustained (historical failure, requires massive violence)
- **Verdict**: Fails pragmatic test

**The ascetic monk**:
- May constrain some capabilities (bodily pleasure, material control) but doesn't eliminate them
- Develops other capabilities (practical reason, senses/imagination/thought, affiliation within community)
- Doesn't systematically undermine others' capabilities
- Can be sustained lifelong by some people
- **Verdict**: Legitimate (though not universally appealing) practical identity

**The workaholic executive**:
- Undermines own capabilities (emotions, affiliation, play, bodily health)
- But doesn't require false beliefs or harm others systematically
- **Verdict**: Suboptimal for agent but not categorically prohibited

### 10.8.6 Pluralism Within the Framework

Important: The list doesn't prescribe single way of life. It specifies capabilities (freedoms) not functionings (actual achievements).

**You flourish by**:
- Having genuine freedom to realize these capabilities
- Choosing which to emphasize (different people weight differently)
- Realizing them in ways that fit your practical identities

**Examples of legitimate variation**:
- Scholar emphasizes thought/imagination; athlete emphasizes bodily health
- Introvert realizes affiliation through few deep bonds; extrovert through many connections
- Religious person finds meaning in spiritual practice; secular person in other pursuits

All can flourish if they possess the capabilities—even if they realize them differently.

### 10.8.7 Addressing Objections

**Objection 1**: "This list is Western/liberal ideology disguised as universal."

**Response**: The capabilities are abstract enough to accommodate diverse realizations. Religious and secular, collectivist and individualist, traditional and modern societies can all enable these capabilities while differing on specifics.

Moreover, when asked directly, people in non-Western societies endorse these capabilities as valuable. This isn't Western imposition but cross-cultural convergence.

**Objection 2**: "Who decides what counts as 'genuine freedom' or 'adequate health'?"

**Response**: This is specification question, not objection to framework. We determine thresholds through:
- Empirical research (what levels of nutrition/health/education enable functioning?)
- Social deliberation (what do affected communities consider adequate?)
- Comparative analysis (what works in practice across contexts?)

**Objection 3**: "Some capabilities conflict. You can't maximize all simultaneously."

**Response**: Correct. The framework doesn't require maximizing all capabilities always. It requires:
- Maintaining threshold level of each (no capability falls below minimum)
- Making trade-offs transparently (not systematically sacrificing some for others)
- Preserving agent's freedom to balance capabilities according to their practical identities

**Objection 4**: "This is still subjective—why these ten rather than others?"

**Response**: The list is provisional and revisable. Nussbaum herself says it's "open-ended and subject to ongoing revision" (34). If evidence showed:
- These capabilities don't actually track wellbeing
- Other capabilities are more fundamental
- The list is culturally biased in ways that matter

I would revise it. This is pragmatist fallibilism in action.

### 10.8.8 The Threshold Question

How much of each capability is required for flourishing? This matters practically.

**Nussbaum's answer**: Each capability has threshold below which human life is not worthy of human dignity. We should bring all people above threshold for all capabilities.

**My addition**: Beyond threshold, trade-offs are permissible. Someone who sacrifices material comfort for artistic pursuit hasn't failed to flourish if they meet threshold and freely chose this.

**The thresholds are**:
- Not absolute (vary somewhat by context)
- Not maximal (adequate suffices; don't need maximum)
- Not static (rise as societies become more capable of providing them)

This acknowledges both:
- Human diversity (people balance capabilities differently)
- Minimum standards (some deprivations are objectively bad)

### 10.8.9 Connecting to Agency

Why does framework emphasize both "agency" and "flourishing"? Aren't these redundant?

No. They're related but distinct:

**Agency**: Capacity for practical reasoning, self-constitution through action, recognition by others. This is what makes you a moral agent.

**Flourishing**: Having capabilities to live well, realize potential, avoid suffering. This is what makes life go well for agents.

**The connection**: Agency is itself one capability (#6: practical reason). But it's special because it enables using other capabilities meaningfully. Without agency, having capabilities is less valuable (paternalism that provides health, education, security but denies autonomy).

So the framework emphasizes:
- **Agency** when discussing what grounds normativity (practical identities)
- **Flourishing** when discussing what makes practices successful (they enable capabilities)

Both are necessary; neither is reducible to the other.

### 10.8.10 Practical Upshot

This specification of flourishing makes pragmatic testing non-circular:

**Before**: "Values are tested by flourishing" (undefined)

**After**: "Values are tested by whether they enable people to possess and exercise central human capabilities while maintaining rational agency"

This is:
- Empirically tractable (we can measure capabilities)
- Not arbitrary (grounded in anthropology, biology, cross-cultural convergence)
- Pluralist (allows diverse realizations)
- Revisable (if evidence shows list is inadequate)

It won't satisfy everyone—philosophers will object to specifics. But it's far better than leaving "flourishing" undefined while using it to justify claims.

## 10.9 Practical Implications

This metaethics is not mere abstract theory. It has practical implications:

**1. Moral inquiry is empirical**: We test values by their consequences, revise in light of experience.

**2. Moral certainty is suspect**: Given fallibilism, dogmatic moral certainty is epistemically unjustified.

**3. Moral community matters**: We need others to test our reasoning and refine our understanding.

**4. Moral progress is possible**: We can genuinely improve our understanding of normativity over time.

**5. Transcendent appeals fail**: We cannot justify values by appeal to God, Platonic forms, or cosmic meaning.

**6. But values remain binding**: Not because transcendent, but because constitutive of agency and tested through experience.

## 10.9 Why This Matters for Pragmatic Existentialism

This metaethics grounds the entire framework:

- **Against Camus**: Shows how values can be binding without transcendence (solves bootstrapping problem)
- **Against Sartre**: Explains why not all choices are equally valid (some undermine agency)
- **Against error theory**: Preserves real normativity within naturalism
- **Against non-naturalism**: Avoids problematic metaphysical commitments
- **For pragmatism**: Provides philosophical foundation for testing values empirically
- **For political action**: Shows why oppression is objectively wrong (undermines agency), not mere preference

Without defensible metaethics, pragmatic existentialism would be mere useful fiction. This chapter shows it rests on solid philosophical foundations—naturalistic, empirically respectable, yet genuinely normative.

Chapter 11 now addresses methodology: how phenomenology and pragmatism can be integrated coherently.
