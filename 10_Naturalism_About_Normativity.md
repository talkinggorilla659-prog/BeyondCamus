# Chapter 10: Naturalism About Normativity

Pragmatic existentialism requires defensible metaethics. This chapter develops naturalism about normativity: values are real features of natural world (not transcendent) yet genuinely normative (not reducible to descriptive facts). This seemingly paradoxical position is coherent and avoids both error theory (there are no values) and non-naturalism (values are transcendent).

## 10.1 The Metaethical Question

Metaethics asks: What is the nature of moral and normative claims? When I say "torture is wrong" or "I ought to keep promises," what am I asserting?

**Realism**: Moral facts exist independent of human attitudes. Murder is wrong regardless of what anyone thinks.

**Anti-realism**: No mind-independent moral facts exist. Moral claims express attitudes, prescribe actions, or project feelings onto world.

**Non-naturalism**: Moral facts exist but are not natural facts. They are sui generis, knowable through intuition or reason.

**Naturalism**: Moral facts are natural facts—but there is disagreement about what this means.

## 10.2 The Challenge for Naturalism

### 10.2.1 The Open Question Argument

G.E. Moore argued that moral properties cannot be identical to natural properties because of the "open question" (*Principia Ethica*, §13). For any natural property N, we can coherently ask: "X has N, but is X good?" This question is open—not answered by definition.

Example: "Pleasure is good." We can coherently ask: "Is pleasure really good?" If "good" meant "pleasurable," this would be like asking "Is pleasure really pleasurable?"—which is closed question, answered by definition.

Therefore, "good" cannot mean any natural property. If moral realism is true, moral properties must be non-natural.

### 10.2.2 The Normativity Problem

Naturalism seems to collapse normativity into description. If "ought" just means some natural fact, it loses normative force. Natural facts describe what is; norms prescribe what should be. How can description become prescription?

### 10.2.3 The Motivation Problem

Moral judgments seem inherently motivating. If I genuinely judge "I ought to help," I am motivated to help (absent weakness of will). But natural facts are not inherently motivating. Learning that X is the case doesn't automatically motivate me to do anything. How can naturalism explain moral judgment's motivational force?

## 10.3 Varieties of Naturalism

### 10.3.1 Analytic Naturalism

Attempt to define moral terms using natural terms. "Good = produces happiness" or "Right = maximizes utility."

This fails for reasons Moore identified. Moral terms cannot be analytically reduced to natural terms without changing meaning.

### 10.3.2 Synthetic Naturalism

Moral properties are identical to natural properties, but not analytically. The identity is discovered empirically, like "Water = H2O."

Example (Richard Boyd): "Good = contributes to human flourishing" is synthetic identity discovered through moral inquiry, not analytic definition.

Problem: How do we discover moral identities? Scientific identities are confirmed by empirical evidence. What confirms moral identities? Seems circular—we identify good with flourishing because we already believe flourishing is good.

### 10.3.3 Non-Reductive Naturalism

Moral properties supervene on natural properties (no moral difference without natural difference) but are not reducible to them. Moral facts are natural facts but require distinctively normative concepts to describe.

This is closer to the position I defend, but needs clarification.

## 10.4 The Pragmatic Naturalist Position

### 10.4.1 The Starting Point

Begin not with abstract metaethics but with phenomenon to explain: we are natural creatures (biological organisms subject to natural law) who nonetheless experience normative demands (oughts, obligations, reasons).

The question is not "Do objective moral facts exist in Platonic realm?" but "How do normative phenomena arise within natural world?"

### 10.4.2 Normativity and Agency

Normativity emerges with agency. Non-agents (rocks, plants) are not subject to norms. They have causal properties but no obligations. Organisms capable of acting on reasons (rational agents) are subject to norms.

This is not mystery requiring transcendent explanation. It is natural fact about certain kinds of organisms. Just as photosynthesis emerges at certain level of biological complexity, normativity emerges at certain level of cognitive sophistication.

### 10.4.3 The Constitutive Account

Following Korsgaard, I argue that normativity is constitutive of rational agency. To be rational agent is to be bound by norms—norms of coherence, consistency, recognition of others, etc.

These norms are not imposed from outside (transcendent realm) or arbitrarily chosen (voluntarism). They are structural features of what it means to be rational agent.

Analogy: To play chess is to be bound by chess rules. The rules are not transcendent facts or arbitrary choices. They constitute what chess is. Similarly, to be rational agent is to be bound by norms constitutive of rational agency.

### 10.4.4 Why This Is Naturalism

This account is naturalistic because:
1. **Agents are natural organisms**: Humans are biological creatures evolved through natural selection
2. **Rationality is natural capacity**: Product of evolution, realized in neural structures
3. **Norms emerge from natural facts**: The fact that we are rational agents (natural fact) generates normative constraints

There is no appeal to transcendent realm, Platonic forms, or supernatural entities. Normativity is natural phenomenon arising at certain level of organizational complexity.

### 10.4.5 Why This Preserves Normativity

This account is genuinely normative because:
1. **Oughts constrain action**: I cannot coherently claim to be rational agent while violating constitutive norms
2. **Reasons provide justification**: Explanations appealing to agency's constitutive structure justify actions
3. **Values bind**: Not because cosmos validates them but because they constitute what I am as agent

The normativity is real even if not transcendent. Compare: chess rules really bind chess players, even though they are not transcendent facts. The binding comes from constitutive role, not metaphysical status.

## 10.5 Responding to Objections

### 10.5.1 "This Makes Morality Optional"

Objection: If norms are constitutive of agency, I can escape them by ceasing to be agent. This makes morality optional.

Response: This objection is incoherent. To deliberate about whether to be agent is already to be agent. I cannot step outside agency to evaluate it from neutral standpoint.

Moreover, "ceasing to be agent" is not trivial option. It requires undermining one's own rational capacities—self-lobotomy or death. These are possible but not "options" in relevant sense. I am stuck being agent so long as I deliberate at all.

### 10.5.2 "This Is Circular"

Objection: You define normativity in terms of agency, then define agency in terms of normativity. This is circular.

Response: Not vicious circle but conceptual interdependence. Agency and normativity are co-constituting. Neither can be fully understood without the other, but this doesn't make explanation circular.

Analogy: "Meaning" and "language" are co-constituting. Words have meaning because they function in language. Language functions because words have meaning. This is not vicious circle but accurate description of interdependent phenomena.

### 10.5.3 "This Doesn't Explain Why I Should Care"

Objection: Even if norms are constitutive of agency, why should I care about being coherent agent? Maybe I prefer incoherence.

Response: This question is self-undermining. "Why should I care?" is demand for reasons. Making this demand presupposes you are engaged in rational deliberation—i.e., constituted as agent responsive to reasons. You cannot coherently ask for reasons while refusing to be reason-responsive.

### 10.5.4 "This Is Just Kant Repackaged"

Objection: You're deriving morality from practical reason, which is what Kant did. Nothing new here.

Response: Important differences:
- **Kant**: Categorical imperative is synthetic a priori truth binding all rational beings universally
- **This view**: Norms emerge from practical identities, which vary situationally

- **Kant**: Morality is purely formal, independent of consequences
- **This view**: Pragmatist testing by consequences is essential

- **Kant**: Noumenal self transcends empirical nature
- **This view**: Agency is natural phenomenon arising in evolved organisms

The resemblance is real (both ground normativity in practical reason), but substantial differences remain.

### 10.5.5 "This Makes Morality Relative"

Objection: If norms emerge from practical identities that vary by individual and culture, this is relativism.

Response: Not pure relativism because:
1. Not all practical identities are coherent (self-undermining ones are ruled out)
2. Recognition of others' agency constrains identities universally
3. Pragmatic testing constrains which identities are sustainable
4. Social deliberation refines values over time

There is more universality than pure relativism, less than Kantian absolutism. Call it "constrained pluralism."

## 10.6 The Is-Ought Gap Reconsidered

The most fundamental metaethical challenge is Hume's is-ought gap: no set of purely descriptive premises can entail normative conclusions. This threatens any naturalist ethics, including the framework I've developed.

In Chapter 12 (§12.7), I claimed to "dissolve" rather than bridge the gap. This requires more careful examination. The honest assessment is: I don't dissolve the gap—I show why it's less problematic than it appears and why my approach handles it better than alternatives.

### 10.6.1 What the Gap Actually Is

Hume observed (*Treatise*, 3.1.1): Authors move from "is" statements (describing what exists) to "ought" statements (prescribing what should be) without explaining the transition. The logical point: descriptive premises alone never entail normative conclusions.

**Example**:
- **Premise**: Humans flourish when recognized as agents
- **Premise**: Recognition requires treating all persons as having equal moral status
- **Conclusion**: Therefore, we ought to recognize all persons as having equal moral status

The conclusion doesn't follow logically. The premises describe facts about flourishing and recognition, but don't establish that we *ought* to value flourishing or recognition.

This is the gap. Any naturalist ethics must cross it somehow—or show why crossing it isn't necessary.

### 10.6.2 Why "Dissolving" Was Too Strong

In Chapter 12, I argued the gap is pseudo-problem arising from demanding external justification for practical reasoning itself. I claimed that agency inherently involves oughts, so asking "why be responsive to oughts?" is incoherent.

This was too quick. The sophisticated critic (like Richard Joyce in *The Evolution of Morality*) responds:

"Yes, practical reasoning involves treating some considerations as normatively binding. But maybe this is just useful fiction—psychological disposition that evolved because it promotes cooperation, not because genuine normative truths exist. The is-ought gap shows that no natural facts (including facts about agency) generate real oughts. They only generate feelings-as-if there are oughts."

This is error theory: moral claims purport to describe objective normative facts, but no such facts exist. All moral claims are systematically false (or non-cognitive).

I cannot simply dissolve the is-ought gap by pointing to agency's structure. I must either:
1. Show how normative facts arise within natural world (ambitious)
2. Defend why practically binding norms are sufficient even if not metaphysically ultimate (modest)

I opt for (2).

### 10.6.3 The Honest Response: Pragmatic Bridging

I don't derive oughts from ises. Instead, I start from the standpoint of practical deliberation—which already involves oughts—and show that certain normative commitments are inescapable *from that standpoint*.

**The structure**:

**Step 1**: Recognize we're always already engaged in practical reasoning. Even the error theorist asking "Why care about norms?" is asking for normative guidance.

**Step 2**: Show that practical reasoning has internal structure involving oughts. To deliberate at all requires treating some considerations as normatively binding (even if provisional).

**Step 3**: Demonstrate that certain norms are constitutive of practical reasoning itself—you can't deliberate coherently while violating them.

**Step 4**: Add pragmatic testing: norms that enable sustainable agency and flourishing are superior to those that don't (this is empirical claim).

**The result**: Oughts emerge not by deriving from ises but by recognizing them as internal to the practice of practical reasoning + testing which oughts work.

This *is* a form of bridging the gap—but pragmatic rather than logical bridging. I'm not deducing oughts from ises; I'm showing that oughts are inescapable features of situated practical reasoning and then testing which oughts are most defensible.

### 10.6.4 Why This Isn't Circular

Objection: "You start with normative practice (agency) to ground normativity. Isn't that circular?"

Response: It's not vicious circle for three reasons:

**First—Reflective equilibrium**: I'm not deducing from fixed starting point. I'm showing mutual support among:
- Phenomenology of practical deliberation
- Structure of rational agency
- Pragmatic consequences of different normative frameworks
- Social sustainability of practices

Each element supports others. This is circular but non-viciously so—it's how all justification works for finite beings.

**Second—Pragmatic test**: The framework is tested by whether it enables flourishing. If following these norms produced systematic suffering or undermined agency, that would be evidence against the framework. The test is external to the theory.

**Third—Comparison to alternatives**: Every metaethical view must start somewhere. The question is which starting point is most defensible:
- Realism starts: "Objective moral facts exist" (metaphysically extravagant)
- Expressivism starts: "Moral claims express attitudes" (can't explain moral reasoning)
- Error theory starts: "No moral facts exist" (unlivable)
- This view starts: "We deliberate practically" (phenomenologically obvious)

Starting from practical deliberation is least question-begging because it's the actual standpoint from which all these debates occur.

### 10.6.5 Comparing Bridges: Why Mine vs. Kierkegaard's Leap?

In Chapter 12, I distinguished my "leap" (to recognition, flourishing, agency) from Kierkegaard's leap to God. Critics will press: what's the difference?

**The differences**:

**1. Epistemic status**:
- **Kierkegaard**: Leaps *against* reason to embrace absurdity ("by virtue of the absurd")
- **My bridge**: Operates *within* reason, showing practical commitments from standpoint of deliberation

**2. Revisability**:
- **Kierkegaard**: Faith requires permanent commitment against doubt
- **My bridge**: Fallibilist—all claims revisable in light of experience

**3. Practical testing**:
- **Kierkegaard**: Cannot test whether God exists by consequences
- **My bridge**: Can test whether recognizing others' agency enables flourishing

**4. Intersubjective agreement**:
- **Kierkegaard**: Faith is radically individual ("knight of faith")
- **My bridge**: Norms are socially tested and refined through collective deliberation

**5. Metaphysical modesty**:
- **Kierkegaard**: Posits transcendent divine reality
- **My bridge**: Makes no claims beyond natural world

So while both involve commitments that can't be proven from neutral standpoint, mine remains within practical reasoning and is empirically testable while his abandons reason for faith.

### 10.6.6 Engaging Joyce's Error Theory

Richard Joyce argues (*The Evolution of Morality*, 2006) that moral norms evolved as useful fictions promoting cooperation. They *feel* binding but aren't genuinely normative. The is-ought gap shows this: no natural facts (including evolutionary facts) generate real oughts.

**My response**:

**Concession**: Joyce is right that oughts don't flow from natural facts by logical entailment. Evolution explains why we *experience* things as normatively binding, but doesn't *justify* treating them as binding.

**But**: This creates practical problem. We are creatures who must deliberate about what to do. Even Joyce, as error theorist, must decide how to act. The question is: which framework for deliberation is most defensible?

**Options**:
1. **Nihilism**: Recognize no oughts are real, act on mere preferences
2. **Fictionalism** (Joyce's view): Treat norms as useful fictions
3. **Constructivism**: Recognize oughts as internal to practical reasoning

**Against nihilism**: Psychologically impossible to sustain. Even Joyce doesn't live this way. He acts on reasons, makes commitments, feels obligations.

**Against fictionalism**: Unstable middle position. If I know norms are fictions, they lose their action-guiding force. Joyce must either:
- Deceive himself (believe norms while "knowing" they're fictions—bad faith)
- Maintain conscious double-consciousness (exhausting and unclear if sustainable)

**For constructivism**: Norms don't need to be cosmically real to be practically binding. They're real *within the practice of practical reasoning*—and that's the only standpoint from which the question matters.

**The key point**: Joyce wants norms to be "objective" in sense of existing independent of our practices. When he shows they don't exist this way, he concludes they're fictions. But this assumes the wrong standard. Norms don't need cosmic objectivity; they need practical authority within deliberation.

My framework provides this without requiring metaphysically spooky entities.

### 10.6.7 The Modest Conclusion

I make no claim to have solved the is-ought problem definitively. Instead:

**What I've shown**:
1. Practical reasoning inherently involves normative commitments
2. Some norms are constitutive of rational agency
3. Norms can be tested pragmatically by consequences
4. This provides sufficient normativity for living well
5. It's more defensible than alternatives

**What I haven't shown**:
1. That oughts exist independent of practical reasoning
2. That someone who opts out of practical reasoning is making logical error
3. That my starting point is uniquely self-evident or unrevisable

**The honest position**: Every metaethical view faces grounding problems. Realism can't explain how we access non-natural facts. Expressivism can't explain moral disagreement or reasoning. Error theory can't be lived. Constructivism can't provide external justification for valuing rationality.

But constructivism + pragmatism handles its grounding problems better than alternatives. It's phenomenologically accurate, metaphysically modest, epistemically tractable, and practically usable.

The is-ought gap remains. But I've shown why crossing it pragmatically is sufficient for ethical life—and superior to alternatives that either deny the gap exists (crude naturalism) or refuse to cross it at all (error theory).

## 10.7 The Pragmatist Addition

Korsgaard's constitutive account is powerful but incomplete. I add pragmatist element: values are tested empirically by their consequences.

### 10.6.1 Moral Epistemology

We discover which norms are genuinely binding through experience. Some practical identities we thought coherent turn out self-undermining. Some values we thought sustainable produce suffering. Some social practices we thought beneficial are actually oppressive.

This is empirical inquiry, not a priori deduction. We learn about normativity through living, not pure reason.

### 10.6.2 Fallibilism

All normative claims are revisable in light of experience. Even seemingly fundamental commitments (honesty, care, justice) may need specification or revision in some contexts.

This fallibilism is feature, not bug. It reflects honest acknowledgment of human finitude and epistemic limitation.

### 10.6.3 Social Inquiry

We test values collectively. Individual agents can be mistaken about what norms truly bind them. Through social deliberation—comparing experiences, criticizing each other's reasoning, observing consequences—we refine understanding of normativity.

This is not "morality is whatever society says" (crude relativism). It is "we discover moral truths through collective inquiry" (social epistemology).

### 10.6.4 Progress

This framework allows for moral progress. Societies learn over time which practices sustain agency and flourishing, which undermine them. This explains historical developments (abolition of slavery, women's rights, LGBTQ inclusion) without requiring that norms were always already true but unrecognized.

## 10.7 The Ontological Status of Values

What are values, metaphysically speaking?

### 10.7.1 Not Platonic Forms

Values are not abstract entities existing independently of natural world. No realm of transcendent values.

### 10.7.2 Not Mere Attitudes

Values are not simply subjective preferences or emotions. When I judge torture wrong, I'm not merely expressing distaste.

### 10.7.3 Response-Dependent Properties

Values are response-dependent: they exist in relation to agents with particular constitutions. "Good" is like "delicious"—not purely subjective (not mere preference) but not fully objective either (depends on tasters).

But response-dependence doesn't make values arbitrary. Just as "delicious" depends on human taste apparatus that is not arbitrary (evolved, shared), "good" depends on human agency structure that is not arbitrary (constitutive, recognizable).

### 10.7.4 Natural But Non-Reducible

Values are natural properties (they arise in natural world, involve natural organisms) but not reducible to non-normative natural properties. Moral language cannot be eliminated in favor of purely descriptive language without loss.

This is non-reductive naturalism. Values supervene on natural facts (no moral difference without natural difference) but require normative concepts to describe.

## 10.3 The Sustainability Test

Throughout this book, I've tested practical identities and values by whether they enable "human flourishing" or "agency." But what do these terms mean? This vagueness is a serious problem. Without specifying what makes practical identities valid, pragmatic testing becomes circular: we test values by their consequences for "flourishing," but flourishing is defined by values we already accept.

Standard responses appeal to lists of goods (Nussbaum's capabilities, Finnis's basic values, Mill's higher pleasures). But these lists appear arbitrary—why these goods rather than others? How do we avoid simply projecting our preferred values onto "flourishing"?

I propose a different criterion, one that follows directly from the framework developed in this book: **The Sustainability Test**. A practical identity is valid to the degree it can be maintained under full consciousness of Absurdist conditions—mortality, contingency, metaphysical silence, and the absence of cosmic validation.

This is not arbitrary. It emerges directly from the book's central claim: What Camus described phenomenologically (meaning-seeking under conditions of silence) and what self-constitution theory describes structurally (practical identity formation) are complementary descriptions of the same phenomenon. If this is correct, then the test for valid practical identities is: Can they survive confrontation with the truth about our condition?

### 10.3.1 What Sustainability Means

A practical identity is sustainable if it can be coherently maintained when the agent:
- **Acknowledges mortality**: Death is absolute horizon; no immortal soul, no eternal rewards
- **Accepts contingency**: The universe is not designed for human flourishing; suffering is not distributed justly; effort does not guarantee success
- **Confronts silence**: No cosmic meaning validates the identity; the universe does not care whether you maintain it
- **Recognizes constructed nature**: The identity is self-constituted, not discovered; it has no transcendent foundation

**The crucial question**: Does the practical identity *collapse* under this recognition, or does it *remain coherent*?

**Why this matters**: If an identity requires self-deception about these features to be maintained, it is structurally unstable. It will eventually collide with reality. Better to adopt identities that accept Absurdist conditions from the start—these are tested by the harshest truths we know and survive.

**This is not a counsel of despair**. It is the opposite: identities that survive full consciousness of the Absurd are stronger precisely because they don't rest on comfortable delusions. They are existentially verified, not cosmically validated.

**What do I mean by "Reality"?** Not ideology, preference, or social construction, but the **pragmatically inescapable constraints** that assert themselves regardless of what we believe or desire:

- **Physical constraints**: Mortality (all biological organisms die), scarcity (resources are finite), embodiment (we have bodies with needs and limits), causation (actions have physical consequences)
- **Biological constraints**: Human beings require food, water, shelter; experience pain and pleasure; have evolved capacities and limitations; are vulnerable to injury and disease
- **Logical constraints**: Contradictions cannot be maintained; if P implies Q and Q is false, P is false; you cannot coherently claim X while denying X's preconditions
- **Phenomenological constraints**: We are conscious, experience the Absurd (the collision between meaning-seeking and meaninglessness), cannot escape the standpoint of agency while deliberating

These are not arbitrary stipulations or Western prejudices. They are constraints that *demonstrate themselves through living*. You can deny mortality philosophically, but your body ages regardless. You can claim logical contradictions are acceptable, but you cannot build a bridge using contradictory mathematics. You can reject the Absurd intellectually, but consciousness confronts you with meaninglessness anyway.

This is reality in the pragmatist sense: what resists wishful thinking, what constrains action, what reasserts itself no matter how we theorize. Practical identities are sustainable to the degree they accept rather than deny these constraints. The three failure modes (metaphysical, energetic, logical) correspond to denying physical/biological constraints, finite resources, and logical coherence respectively.

Crucially, these constraints—finitude, contingency, and the gap between value and world—apply regardless of one's metaphysical commitments. Even the believer must interpret divine will through finite human understanding; even the theist faces the silence of the gap between text and action. Therefore, the Sustainability Test is not a test of atheism, but a test of robustness. It asks: Does this identity survive if the universe does not cooperate with your specific metaphysical wager? A sustainable identity is one that accounts for the 'worst-case' scenario of silence, thereby making it antifragile even in the 'best-case' scenario of faith.

### 10.3.2 Three Failure Modes

Practical identities fail the sustainability test in three ways: metaphysical collapse, energetic collapse, and logical collapse.

#### **Failure Mode 1: Metaphysical Collapse**

An identity suffers metaphysical collapse when it requires beliefs about reality that are **false** or **unjustified**, such that when the agent confronts the actual nature of reality, the identity cannot be maintained.

**Examples**:

**The religious fundamentalist** (certain forms):
- Identity requires: Literal truth of sacred texts; cosmic justice ensuring righteous are rewarded; divine endorsement of actions
- Reality: No evidence for these metaphysical claims; suffering is not distributed according to virtue; universe shows no signs of moral governance
- **Why it collapses**: When faced with theodicy (innocent suffering), contingency (random tragedy), or empirical evidence contradicting texts, the identity requires either rejecting evidence or abandoning the identity
- **Note**: Not all religious identities fail this test—those that don't require literal metaphysical claims or cosmic justice can survive

**The Nazi/racial supremacist**:
- Identity requires: Biological racial hierarchy; inherent superiority of some groups; historical destiny of master race
- Reality: Genetic science shows no basis for racial hierarchy; no evidence of inherent superiority; history shows no teleological direction
- **Why it collapses**: The identity rests on empirical falsehoods. When confronted with actual biology, anthropology, and history, adherents must either reject science or abandon the identity
- **Moreover**: Maintaining the identity requires escalating violence to suppress evidence of falsity—treating members of "inferior" races as equals would expose the lie

**The Marxist teleologist** (certain forms):
- Identity requires: History has dialectical logic; communist society is inevitable; individual sacrifice serves historical necessity
- Reality: No evidence history has inherent direction; no guarantee of progress; many "historically necessary" movements failed
- **Why it collapses**: When revolution doesn't come, when communist experiments produce suffering, when "historical necessity" is revealed as projection, the identity loses foundation

**The pattern**: These identities require the universe to be *other than it is*. They depend on false metaphysics (racial hierarchy, divine justice, historical teleology). Reality eventually intrudes, forcing either cognitive dissonance or identity abandonment.

#### **Failure Mode 2: Energetic Collapse**

An identity suffers energetic collapse when it requires **infinite resources** or **denial of finitude**, such that maintaining it exhausts the agent or demands what finite beings cannot sustain.

**Examples**:

**The pure hedonist** (pleasure maximization):
- Identity requires: Constant pursuit of pleasure; avoidance of all discomfort; treating every moment as opportunity for gratification
- Reality: Pleasure habituates (requires escalation); pain is inevitable; mortality cannot be denied forever
- **Why it collapses**: Eventually age, illness, or tragedy intrudes. The hedonist identity has no resources for confronting suffering—it can only deny or flee it. When denial becomes impossible, the identity offers nothing

**The workaholic** (identity entirely defined by productivity):
- Identity requires: Ignoring bodily limits; treating rest as waste; deriving all worth from output
- Reality: Bodies break down; burnout occurs; mortality looms; productivity eventually declines
- **Why it collapses**: The agent cannot maintain perpetual productivity. When bodies fail or retirement comes, the identity that depended entirely on work has nothing left

**The utopian revolutionary** (certain forms):
- Identity requires: Treating present as mere means to future perfection; sacrificing everything for coming utopia; ignoring current suffering for future redemption
- Reality: The perfect society never arrives; sacrifices mount; current lives are the only lives we have
- **Why it collapses**: After decades of deferred gratification for utopia that doesn't come, the identity requires either doubling down (denying evidence) or collapsing into despair

**The pattern**: These identities deny fundamental constraints (mortality, bodily limits, finitude). They require more than finite beings can give. Eventually, reality enforces the limits, and identities that depend on denying them break.

#### **Failure Mode 3: Logical Collapse**

An identity suffers logical collapse when it contains **internal contradictions** or **undermines its own conditions of possibility**.

**Examples**:

**The pure egoist** (recognizing no obligations):
- Identity requires: Acting purely on self-interest; recognizing no genuine obligations
- Problem: Practical reasoning requires treating some considerations as *reasons* (having normative force), not mere preferences
- **Why it collapses**: If nothing is genuinely normative, the egoist has no grounds even for self-interest. Self-interest becomes mere preference with no rational authority. The identity undermines the normativity it depends on

**The liar** (Korsgaard's example):
- Identity requires: Systematically deceiving others
- Problem: Communication requires shared norms of truthfulness
- **Why it collapses**: If I'm known as liar, my utterances cannot function as communication. The identity defeats itself by undermining conditions of linguistic exchange

**The pure relativist**:
- Identity requires: Claiming all values are equally valid, none privileged
- Problem: This claim itself is normative—it says we *should* treat all values as equal
- **Why it collapses**: The position performs what it denies. If all values are relative, so is relativism itself. The identity cannot consistently maintain its own stance

**The pattern**: These identities are internally incoherent. They depend on structures (normativity, communication, evaluation) that they simultaneously undermine. No amount of commitment can make them stable—logic itself defeats them.

### 10.3.3 Why the Nazi Fails (The Complete Argument)

The Nazi identity is often cited as test case for ethical frameworks. Can we show it's wrong without appealing to transcendent values? The sustainability test provides the resources.

The Nazi identity fails **all three** sustainability tests:

**1. Metaphysical Collapse**:
- Requires false biological/historical claims about racial hierarchy
- Cannot survive contact with actual science
- Needs escalating violence to suppress evidence of falsity (treating Jews as capable scientists, artists, professionals exposes the lie of inferiority)
- Like all identities based on empirical falsehoods, reality eventually intrudes

**2. Energetic Collapse**:
- Requires infinite violence to maintain
- Every generation of "inferior" people must be suppressed
- Constant enforcement necessary because the suppressed will resist (they are agents, after all)
- Unsustainable: Nazi Germany lasted 12 years before catastrophic collapse

**3. Logical Collapse**:
- Claims to value strength, excellence, civilization
- But depends on denying agency to those with these very qualities
- Undermines the goods it claims to pursue (cannot develop science, art, culture when suppressing talented people)
- Moreover: Recognition requirement (Chapter 5) shows agency itself requires recognizing others; Nazi systematically refuses this, becoming something less than fully rational agent

**The pragmatic test**: History shows Nazi identity collapsed spectacularly—not because God intervened, but because identities requiring false metaphysics, infinite violence, and logical contradiction are structurally unsustainable.

**Why this is not circular**: I'm not saying "Nazi is wrong because I don't like it." I'm saying "Nazi identity cannot be sustained under full consciousness of reality—it requires metaphysical delusions, impossible resources, and performative contradictions."

Someone might respond: "But Nazis *did* maintain the identity!" Yes, for 12 years, through massive self-deception, propaganda suppressing evidence, and unsustainable violence. The identity's collapse was inevitable, built into its structure. That's the test.

### 10.3.3a The Deeper Point: Fighting Reality Is Energetically Expensive

The Nazi objection reveals a deeper principle about sustainable practical identities: **identities that fight reality are thermodynamically doomed**.

This is not metaphor. Consider the energetic requirements of maintaining the Nazi identity:

**Observation 1: Reality continuously provides counterevidence**
- Jews demonstrating scientific excellence (Einstein, Bohr, hundreds of others)
- Jews creating great art, literature, philosophy
- Jews exhibiting precisely the "superior" qualities Nazis claim for themselves
- Mixed families showing no biological differences

**Observation 2: Suppressing this evidence requires energy**
- Book burning (physical destruction of counterevidence)
- Propaganda systems (continuous reframing of observable facts)
- Violence against exemplars (murdering those who demonstrate inconvenient excellence)
- Educational indoctrination (preventing each new generation from noticing reality)

**Observation 3: Reality doesn't stop**
- Every day generates new counterevidence
- Every birth produces new humans who might notice the contradictions
- Every scientific advance threatens the metaphysical framework
- The evidence generation is *entropic*—it increases over time

**The thermodynamic argument**: An identity requiring continuous suppression of accumulating evidence consumes unbounded energy. Like a perpetual motion machine fighting friction, it cannot be sustained indefinitely. The Nazi identity didn't collapse because God intervened or because of moral progress—it collapsed because *fighting reality is expensive* and Germany ran out of resources.

**Why this matters philosophically**: This grounds the sustainability test not just in logical coherence but in physical constraint. An identity might be *logically* formulable (I can write down "Some humans have agency, others don't") without being *energetically* sustainable (maintaining this belief while interacting with humans requires infinite cognitive energy to reframe their agency-demonstrating behaviors).

**Generalization to all identities**: Any practical identity requiring systematic denial of observable features of reality will face escalating energetic costs:
- The youth-identity must suppress evidence of aging (cosmetic interventions, social isolation, increasingly desperate measures)
- The success-identity denying contingency must explain away each failure (conspiracy theories, blame, cognitive gymnastics)
- The religious literalist must suppress scientific evidence (book banning, hermetic communities, intellectual isolation)

These identities can be maintained temporarily, at cost. But the cost escalates because reality doesn't stop generating evidence.

**In contrast: Identities accepting reality from the start**

The committed parent who accepts mortality, contingency, and cosmic silence faces reality head-on. When child suffers, parent doesn't need to deny the suffering, explain it away as divine punishment, suppress evidence of randomness, or maintain elaborate theological frameworks. The parent can simply respond: "Yes, this is terrible. Yes, it's random. Yes, I'm mortal and cannot ultimately prevent all harm. And I remain committed to my child's flourishing despite these truths."

**This is energetically cheap.** Reality confirms rather than contradicts the identity's assumptions. No escalating suppression required.

**The principle**: Practical identities sustainable under Absurdist conditions are those requiring minimal energy to maintain against accumulating evidence. This is why accepting meaninglessness, mortality, and contingency from the start—rather than fighting them—produces more stable identities. You're working with reality's grain, not against it.

The Nazi identity is paradigm case of entropic doom: an identity that could only be maintained by fighting the second law of thermodynamics. It was doomed from conception, not by morality but by physics.

### 10.3.4 Why Pragmatic Absurdism Succeeds

In contrast, practical identities that accept Absurdist conditions from the start are structurally stable.

**The craftsman** (example):
- Acknowledges mortality: "My work won't last forever, and that's fine"
- Accepts contingency: "I may fail, market may not value my work, I may lose ability through injury"
- Confronts silence: "The universe doesn't care about my craft, but I do"
- Recognizes construction: "I chose this identity through action and commitment, not discovery of cosmic purpose"

**Why it survives**: The identity makes no claims that reality contradicts. It doesn't require immortality, guaranteed success, cosmic validation, or perfect justice. When tragedy strikes (workshop burns down, arthritis develops, work goes unappreciated), the identity has resources for response: "I knew this could happen. The identity wasn't based on outcomes but on engagement with the craft itself."

**The committed parent**:
- Acknowledges mortality: "I cannot ultimately save my child from death"
- Accepts contingency: "My child may suffer undeserved hardships; my parenting may fail despite best efforts"
- Confronts silence: "No cosmic plan designated me as parent or ensures my child's flourishing"
- Recognizes construction: "I chose this identity and constitute myself as parent through ongoing action"

**Why it survives**: When parenting is hard, when children suffer, when outcomes aren't perfect—the identity doesn't collapse. It was never based on false promises of protection or guaranteed success. The parent who accepts finitude and contingency from the start can continue parenting through tragedy.

**The pattern**: Identities that begin with clear-eyed recognition of Absurdist conditions don't break when confronted with those conditions. They are pre-adapted to the truth. This is not resignation but realism—and realism is more stable than delusion.

### 10.3.5 The Testability Criterion

A crucial advantage of the sustainability test: **it's empirically testable**.

We can observe:
- **Which identities people abandon** when confronted with mortality, tragedy, evidence
- **Which require escalating self-deception** to maintain
- **Which produce breakdowns** (cognitive dissonance, despair, violence)
- **Which remain stable** through changing circumstances

**Examples of empirical evidence**:

**Observation 1**: People who ground identity entirely in youth/beauty often experience crisis when aging occurs. Those who grounded identity in developing capacities (wisdom, relationships, craft) transition more smoothly. The sustainability test predicts this: identities denying mortality fail when mortality intrudes.

**Observation 2**: Religious believers who interpret texts literally often face crisis when confronted with scientific evidence or problem of evil. Those with less literal interpretations show more stability. The test predicts: identities requiring false metaphysics are less stable than those compatible with evidence.

**Observation 3**: Totalitarian movements (Nazism, Stalinism, Maoism) required massive violence and eventually collapsed. Movements that didn't promise utopia or require false metaphysics (pragmatic social democracy, for instance) proved more sustainable. The test predicts: identities requiring impossible conditions will fail.

**Observation 4**: People who find meaning through "engagement with practices" (craft, relationships, inquiry) report more stable wellbeing than those seeking "happiness" or "success." The test predicts: identities accepting contingency (outcomes not guaranteed) more stable than those requiring specific results.

This is not proof, but it's evidence. The sustainability test generates predictions that can be checked against human experience. That's more than most ethical frameworks offer.

### 10.3.6 The Pluralism Within Constraint

Important: The sustainability test doesn't prescribe a single way of life. It specifies **constraints**, not content.

**Many practical identities pass the test**:
- The craftsman and the scientist (both engage capacities without denying finitude)
- The parent and the teacher (both develop others' agency without requiring perfect outcomes)
- The activist and the artist (both create meaning through engagement without cosmic guarantees)
- The religious contemplative and the secular philosopher (both can maintain identity without false metaphysics if appropriately conceived)

**These identities differ radically in content** but share structure: they can be sustained under full consciousness of Absurdist conditions.

**The test rules out**:
- Identities requiring false metaphysics
- Identities denying fundamental constraints
- Identities undermining their own conditions

But within those constraints, **vast diversity** remains possible.

### 10.3.7 Addressing the "Still Arbitrary" Objection

Critic: "You've just replaced Nussbaum's arbitrary list with an arbitrary criterion. Why should we accept 'sustainability under Absurdist conditions' as the test?"

**Response**: This isn't arbitrary because it follows directly from the book's central argument.

**The derivation**:

1. **Phenomenological premise** (Chapter 1): We are meaning-seeking beings confronting an indifferent universe (Camus's diagnosis)

2. **Structural implication** (Chapter 5, Section 5.1): Meaning-seeking = self-constitution through practical identities (phenomenology implies structure)

3. **Absurdist constraints** (Chapter 5, Section 5.1.4): Self-constitution happens under conditions of mortality, contingency, silence, no cosmic validation (these are the background conditions)

4. **Pragmatist methodology** (Chapter 11): Values are tested by whether they work—whether they can be sustained through experience

5. **Sustainability criterion follows**: If meaning-seeking = self-constitution under Absurdist constraints, then valid practical identities = those sustainable under those constraints

**The criterion isn't stipulated**; it's **derived from the framework's premises**. If you accept that we are self-constituting agents under Absurdist conditions (the book's central claim), then sustainability under those conditions is the logically appropriate test.

**Moreover**: This criterion has bite. It rules out substantial categories of practical identities (those requiring false metaphysics, denying finitude, or logically incoherent). It's not vacuous or question-begging.

### 10.3.8 Integration with Pragmatism

The sustainability test integrates perfectly with pragmatist methodology:

**Dewey's pragmatism**: Test ideas by their consequences in experience
**Applied here**: Test practical identities by whether they survive confrontation with reality (mortality, contingency, evidence)

**James's pragmatism**: Beliefs are true if they "work" (enable successful navigation of experience)
**Applied here**: Practical identities are valid if they "work" (remain coherent under full consciousness of our condition)

**Peirce's pragmatism**: Truth is what would be accepted by the community of inquiry in the long run
**Applied here**: Valid practical identities are those that survive long-term testing by people living under Absurdist conditions

The sustainability test is **weaponized pragmatism**—testing against the hardest cases (mortality, tragedy, evidence of contingency) rather than easier cases (does it make me happy? does it feel good?).

This makes the test more demanding, not less. Identities that survive sustainability testing have been stress-tested against fundamental realities. They are pragmatically verified in the strongest sense.

### 10.3.9 Why This Solves the Circularity Problem

**The original problem**: "You test values by consequences for flourishing, but define flourishing by your preferred values."

**How sustainability test solves it**:

**The test is external to my value preferences**. I don't choose what counts as "mortality" or "contingency" or "metaphysical silence"—these are features of reality independent of my preferences.

**The test has objective content**: An identity either does or doesn't require false metaphysics; it either can or cannot be maintained under full consciousness of finitude.

**The test is empirically tractable**: We can observe which identities people abandon when confronted with tragedy, which require self-deception, which produce stability.

**Example**: I don't personally endorse Nazi ideology. But the sustainability test shows it fails **independently of my preferences**:
- It requires false biological claims (objective fact)
- It collapsed historically (empirical observation)
- It demands infinite violence (structural analysis)
- It undermines goods it claims to pursue (logical analysis)

None of this depends on whether I like or dislike Nazism. The test is external.

**Contrast with Nussbaum's list**: Why ten capabilities rather than nine or eleven? The list seems stipulated—a reflection of contemporary Western liberal values, however well-justified. The sustainability test, by contrast, is **derived from the framework's core claims** and **tested against reality**.

### 10.3.10 Practical Upshot

The sustainability test provides concrete guidance for evaluating practical identities:

**Questions to ask**:

1. **Metaphysical test**: Does this identity require beliefs I know are false or unjustified? Does it depend on cosmic justice, guaranteed outcomes, or transcendent validation?

2. **Finitude test**: Can I maintain this identity while fully acknowledging mortality, contingency, and the possibility of failure? Or does it require denying limits?

3. **Lucidity test**: Could I maintain this identity while remaining fully conscious of the Absurd—while knowing the universe doesn't care, that there's no cosmic meaning, that outcomes aren't guaranteed?

4. **Stability test**: Do I observe people abandoning this identity when confronted with tragedy or evidence? Does it require increasing self-deception over time?

**If the identity passes these tests**, it is a viable candidate for adoption—not because it's transcendently validated, but because it's structurally stable under the conditions we actually face.

**If the identity fails these tests**, it will eventually collapse—if not for you, then for others; if not now, then when reality intrudes more forcefully.

**This is existentially verified ethics**: Not ethics derived from cosmic facts or pure reason, but ethics tested against the harshest truths we know and found sustainable. That is as close to "objective" as finite beings can get.

## 10.9 Practical Implications

This metaethics is not mere abstract theory. It has practical implications:

**1. Moral inquiry is empirical**: We test values by their consequences, revise in light of experience.

**2. Moral certainty is suspect**: Given fallibilism, dogmatic moral certainty is epistemically unjustified.

**3. Moral community matters**: We need others to test our reasoning and refine our understanding.

**4. Moral progress is possible**: We can genuinely improve our understanding of normativity over time.

**5. Transcendent appeals fail**: We cannot justify values by appeal to God, Platonic forms, or cosmic meaning.

**6. But values remain binding**: Not because transcendent, but because constitutive of agency and tested through experience.

## 10.9 Why This Matters for Pragmatic Existentialism

This metaethics grounds the entire framework:

- **Against Camus**: Shows how values can be binding without transcendence (solves bootstrapping problem)
- **Against Sartre**: Explains why not all choices are equally valid (some undermine agency)
- **Against error theory**: Preserves real normativity within naturalism
- **Against non-naturalism**: Avoids problematic metaphysical commitments
- **For pragmatism**: Provides philosophical foundation for testing values empirically
- **For political action**: Shows why oppression is objectively wrong (undermines agency), not mere preference

Without defensible metaethics, pragmatic existentialism would be mere useful fiction. This chapter shows it rests on solid philosophical foundations—naturalistic, empirically respectable, yet genuinely normative.

Chapter 11 now addresses methodology: how phenomenology and pragmatism can be integrated coherently.
