# Chapter 7: Living With Purpose (Without Purpose)

Pragmatic existentialism provides philosophical foundation. But philosophy should illuminate life. This chapter shows what the framework means practically: How do we choose careers, sustain relationships, raise children, face suffering, confront mortality? How do we live with purpose when the universe offers no purpose?

I proceed by considering key life domains where questions of meaning arise most urgently. For each, I show how pragmatic existentialism provides guidance where absurdism and existentialism fail.

## 7.1 Work and Vocation

### 7.1.1 The Question

We spend most of our waking lives working. Is this time meaningful or wasted? How do we choose what work to do? What makes work worth doing?

Camus offers: maintain consciousness of absurdity while working. Sisyphus pushing boulder is paradigm. But this provides no guidance for choosing work or sustaining motivation.

Sartre offers: choose authentically. But all choices are equally arbitrary if not cosmically validated. Why this career rather than another?

### 7.1.2 The Pragmatic Existentialist Answer

Work is meaningful when it emerges from practical identities and engages internal goods of practices.

**Questions to ask:**
1. What practical identities does this work constitute? (teacher, healer, builder, artist)
2. What internal goods does the practice offer? (understanding, health, shelter, beauty)
3. Do my capacities fit the practice's demands?
4. Does the work contribute to human flourishing broadly construed?
5. Can I sustain this work through changing circumstances?

These questions have answers. Not cosmic answers, but situated ones emerging from my biology, history, values, and relationships.

### 7.1.3 The External Goods Problem

Much contemporary work offers only external goods—money, status—without access to internal goods. Corporate jobs focused solely on shareholder returns, bureaucratic roles divorced from mission, labor treated as mere commodity.

Pragmatic existentialism illuminates why such work feels meaningless: it does not engage genuine practices with internal goods. The solution is not resignation (Camus's maintaining tension) but reconstruction—either finding practices within one's current work or transitioning to work that offers genuine internal goods.

This is not always possible given economic constraints. But the framework at least clarifies what is missing and why, and suggests that social structures preventing access to meaningful work are objectionably unjust—they undermine conditions of meaningful agency.

### 7.1.4 The Mortality Objection

"But all work is ultimately futile given mortality. Why pursue excellence in craft if I will die and be forgotten?"

Because meaning does not require permanence. Work is meaningful when it engages my capacities, develops excellence, contributes to practices I value, and connects me to others—all of this is real and valuable during my lifetime, even if universe will eventually end.

The demand for permanent significance is confused. Meaning is necessarily temporally bounded for finite beings. That my work will be forgotten eventually does not make it meaningless now.

## 7.2 Love and Relationships

### 7.2.1 The Question

Can love be meaningful if it is not cosmically destined? How do we commit to relationships while acknowledging their contingency? What grounds fidelity if no transcendent bond unites us?

Camus: maintain lucid awareness that love lacks ultimate justification while loving passionately. But this seems psychologically implausible—can I love fully while constantly aware that nothing grounds this love?

Sartre: I freely choose to love, and this choice binds me. But if I can freely create obligation, I can freely dissolve it. This makes commitment mysterious.

### 7.2.2 The Pragmatic Existentialist Answer

Love is meaningful when it involves mutual recognition of agency, development of shared practical identities, and transformation of each person through relationship.

When I commit to partnership:
- I constitute myself as partner (practical identity)
- I recognize my partner as agent with their own standpoint and projects
- We develop shared practices and internal goods (intimacy, trust, co-created life)
- The relationship transforms who I am—I become different person through loving

This grounds commitment. I am bound not by cosmic decree but by identity-constitution. To abandon the relationship casually would require becoming different person—which is possible but not trivial.

### 7.2.3 The Contingency

The relationship is contingent. I might have loved someone else. If we had never met, neither would feel incomplete. There is no "soulmate" destined for me.

But this contingency does not undermine meaning. This relationship, with this person, now—generates real meaning through mutual transformation and shared life. That it might have been otherwise is irrelevant. It *is* this way, and that is sufficient.

### 7.2.4 When Relationships End

Some relationships should end—when they become oppressive, when people grow incompatibly, when transformation becomes stagnation.

Pragmatic existentialism helps here. We evaluate relationships by consequences for agency and flourishing. Relationships that systematically undermine either party's agency are problematic regardless of commitment. Staying in such relationships is not virtue but self-betrayal.

Ending relationships involves loss and grief—but not failure of meaning. The relationship was meaningful while it lasted. Its ending does not retroactively erase that meaning. We live forward, not backward.

## 7.3 Parenting

### 7.3.1 The Question

Why have children if universe is meaningless? How do we raise children without transcendent values? What do we teach them about meaning?

Camus is silent on parenting (characteristic of his individualism). Sartre is worse—his radical freedom makes parenting philosophically problematic. How can I shape my child's values if they are radically free?

### 7.3.2 The Pragmatic Existentialist Answer

Parenting is practical identity that transforms the agent and develops the child as agent.

We have children not because universe commands it but because:
- Parenting engages distinctive human capacities (care, teaching, connection)
- The relationship is uniquely transformative for both parties
- It contributes to practices that extend beyond our lifetime
- It is form of self-transcendence—caring for being whose flourishing matters more than our own

These are sufficient reasons, even if not cosmic.

### 7.3.3 What We Teach

We transmit values—but not as cosmic truths. We teach:
- These are values I have found sustaining through deliberation and experience
- These values emerge from practices I consider worth preserving
- You must critically examine these values and appropriate or modify them
- You are agent—you will constitute yourself through your choices
- Your choices matter even if not cosmically validated

This is not relativism ("all values are equal"). It is fallibilism ("I believe these values but remain open to revision") combined with honoring children's agency ("You must decide for yourself, though I will guide your development").

### 7.3.4 The Asymmetry Problem

Objection: If values are not transcendent, what right do I have to impose them on my children?

Response: I do not impose; I educate. Children are not yet fully agents—they must develop agency through learning language, values, practices. This necessarily involves transmission of particular values.

The obligation is not to be value-neutral (impossible) but to transmit values while developing children's capacity for critical reflection. I teach them values *and* teach them to evaluate values. The goal is not clones but autonomous agents.

## 7.4 Suffering and Tragedy

### 7.4.1 The Question

How do we respond to suffering when no cosmic meaning redeems it? How do we face tragedy—child's death, terminal illness, natural disaster—without appeal to divine plan?

This is where absurdism is supposed to help. Camus insists we accept suffering without seeking transcendent justification. But this provides no guidance. How do we actually live through tragedy?

### 7.4.2 The Pragmatic Existentialist Answer

We do not seek cosmic meaning in suffering because there is none. Suffering is not redemptive, does not build character necessarily, does not happen for a reason. It is simply tragic—evil or pain without compensating good.

But we can respond to suffering:
- **Through practices of care**: Medicine, therapy, community support
- **Through solidarity**: Recognizing others' suffering and responding
- **Through meaning-preservation**: Maintaining practical identities and relationships despite suffering
- **Through resistance**: Fighting unjust suffering where possible

The difference from Camus: we do not just "maintain consciousness" of suffering. We act to reduce it (where possible), bear it with others (when unavoidable), and preserve meaning despite it.

### 7.4.3 Grief

When we lose someone we love, grief is appropriate response. The relationship was meaningful—it constituted part of our identity. Loss of the person is genuine loss of part of ourselves.

Grief does not require cosmic framework. The person mattered to me through our relationship. Their absence is real harm. The meaning of the relationship does not require that their death served purpose or that we will reunite in afterlife.

Pragmatic existentialism validates grief while avoiding false consolation. The loss is real and permanent. And that is terrible. No philosophy should minimize this.

### 7.4.4 Injustice

Injustice is suffering that need not be. Someone is harmed through social structures or individual actions when they could have been helped.

Pragmatic existentialism grounds opposition to injustice. Unjust suffering undermines agency—for victims directly, and for all of us indirectly by eroding social conditions of meaning.

We are obligated to oppose injustice not because cosmic law demands it but because we are socially constituted agents who depend on practices that respect agency. Allowing injustice is complicity in eroding these conditions.

## 7.5 Mortality

### 7.5.1 The Question

How do we live meaningfully given certain death? If everything ends, does anything matter?

Camus: accept mortality and live fully anyway. Sisyphus knows the boulder will fall but pushes it anyway.

But this misunderstands the problem. The question is not whether to accept mortality (we have no choice) but how to make peace with it.

### 7.5.2 The Pragmatic Existentialist Answer

Mortality is not problem requiring solution but condition of human meaning. Finite beings have meaningful lives because our time matters. If we were immortal, nothing would be urgent. Every choice could be postponed indefinitely.

Meaning requires finite time. I must choose this career because I cannot pursue all careers. I must commit to these relationships because time is scarce. I must act on my values now because I will not have another chance.

This is not rationalization. It is recognition that meaning and mortality are connected. The universe's indifference does not threaten meaning; it makes meaning possible by leaving space for human significance.

### 7.5.3 Legacy

We want to leave something beyond our life—children, works, contributions. Is this irrational if everything eventually ends?

No. Legacy is not about permanent cosmic impact. It is about contributing to practices that transcend our individual existence. I teach students who will teach others. I create art that influences other artists. I advance knowledge that others build upon. I raise children who will create their own meanings.

This is self-transcendence: my agency extends beyond my lifetime through participation in practices. Not cosmic significance, but genuine connection to human project that exceeds me.

### 7.5.4 Fear of Death

Some fear death—extinction of consciousness, loss of future possibilities. Is this irrational?

No. Fear of death is appropriate response to genuine loss. But the fear can be managed:
- **Meaning now**: Focus on present meaning rather than fantasizing about infinite future
- **Acceptance of limits**: Recognize that finite life is only kind we can have
- **Connection to others**: Our practices and relationships extend beyond us
- **Mortality as boundary**: Death gives shape and urgency to life

Pragmatic existentialism does not eliminate fear of death. But it removes the added anguish of thinking death makes life meaningless. Life is meaningful despite—partly because of—mortality.

## 7.6 Major Decisions

### 7.6.1 The Framework

How do we make major life decisions when no cosmic meaning guides us?

Pragmatic existentialism provides decision-making framework:

1. **Practical identity questions**: What identities does this choice constitute or express? Do I reflectively endorse those identities?

2. **Capacity questions**: Does this choice engage my genuine capacities? Will I develop excellence?

3. **Social questions**: How does this choice affect practices I value? Does it contribute to or undermine them?

4. **Consequences**: What are likely outcomes for my flourishing and others'? Can I live with those consequences?

5. **Revision**: Can I revise this decision later if circumstances change?

6. **Integration**: Does this choice cohere with my other commitments and values?

These questions are answerable through deliberation. Not definitively—we remain fallible. But well enough to act with reasonable confidence.

### 7.6.2 Career Transitions

Example: Should I leave secure but unfulfilling job for risky creative work?

**Framework analysis**:
- Identity: Does creative work express practical identities I endorse? Does current work prevent me from being who I want to be?
- Capacity: Do I have talents for creative work? Am I wasting capacities in current work?
- Social: Does creative work contribute to practices I value? Does current work undermine them?
- Consequences: Can I manage financial risk? How will this affect dependents?
- Revision: If creative work fails, can I return to secure work?
- Integration: Does creative work cohere with other commitments (partnership, parenthood)?

This does not provide algorithm. But it structures deliberation and identifies relevant considerations. We decide by weighing factors given our situation—not by discovering cosmic truth but by practical reasoning.

### 7.6.3 The Regret Problem

"But what if I choose wrongly and regret it?"

We will make mistakes. All choices involve uncertainty. Pragmatic existentialism's fallibilism accepts this.

The question is not how to avoid regret but how to minimize it and live with it when it comes:
- Deliberate carefully before deciding
- Accept that perfect knowledge is impossible
- Revise when experience shows decision was mistaken
- Forgive yourself for choosing wrong with information available then

Regret is part of finite agency. We cannot escape it, but we can refuse to be paralyzed by it.

## 7.7 The Psychological Sustainability Question

Is this framework livable? Can people actually live this way—without cosmic meaning, without transcendent purpose, making choices from practical reasoning alone?

Yes—because most people already do, implicitly. Few people genuinely believe their choices are cosmically validated. Most navigate life through practical reasoning about capacities, relationships, values.

What pragmatic existentialism provides is not new way of living but philosophical articulation of how we already live when reflective and authentic. It makes explicit what is implicit in mature agency.

The difference from absurdism: I do not maintain constant consciousness of meaninglessness. I engage with projects and relationships most of the time. Reflection is periodic, not permanent. This is psychologically sustainable.

The difference from religious frameworks: I do not appeal to transcendence, but neither do I feel its absence as lack. Human meaning suffices—not as second-best but as the only kind possible for beings like us.

## 7.8 Summary

Pragmatic existentialism provides practical guidance for:
- **Work**: Choose practices with internal goods that engage capacities
- **Love**: Commit through identity-constitution and mutual recognition
- **Parenting**: Transmit values while developing children's autonomy
- **Suffering**: Respond through care and resistance, without false consolation
- **Mortality**: Accept finitude as condition of meaning, not its negation
- **Decisions**: Deliberate using framework of practical identities, capacities, consequences

This is how we live with purpose when universe offers no purpose. The purposes are ours—constructed through situated agency, tested by consequences, sustained through practices. They are real and binding despite being human.

Chapter 8 explores specific ethical cases where this framework is applied to concrete dilemmas. Chapter 9 addresses the contemporary meaning crisis and shows why pragmatic existentialism responds where alternatives fail.
