# Chapter 5a: Defending Self-Constitution Against Its Critics

Chapter 5 developed the self-constitution framework as solution to absurdism's ethical bootstrapping problem. But this framework faces serious philosophical objections. Christine Korsgaard's constructivism—on which I rely heavily—has been challenged by sophisticated critics who argue it fails to ground genuine normativity.

This chapter addresses those objections directly. I show that self-constitution survives the strongest criticisms, though the defense requires clarifications and concessions. The resulting framework is more modest than Korsgaard's full system but sufficient for pragmatic existentialism's purposes.

## 5a.1 The Shmagency Objection

### 5a.1.1 Enoch's Challenge

David Enoch poses the most devastating objection to constructivism: the "shmagency" problem (*Taking Morality Seriously*, 69-73). His argument runs:

**P1**: Constructivism claims normativity emerges from the constitutive structure of rational agency.

**P2**: But I can coherently ask: "Why should I be a rational agent?"

**P3**: I could instead be a "shmagent"—someone who acts on impulses without treating them as normatively justified, who doesn't care about coherence or consistency.

**P4**: Constructivism has no response. It can only say: "If you're an agent, you're bound by norms." But this makes normativity conditional on accepting agency.

**Conclusion**: Constructivism doesn't ground objective normativity—it just shows that IF you care about being an agent, THEN certain norms apply. This is hypothetical, not categorical.

### 5a.1.2 My Initial Response (Why It Fails)

In Chapter 12 (§12.5.1), I responded: "To deliberate about whether to be an agent is already to be an agent." But Enoch anticipates this. The shmagent doesn't deliberate about whether to be an agent. They simply *act*—on desires, impulses, habits—without treating these as justified by reasons.

I cannot claim their position is incoherent. Many non-human animals are shmagents (they act without normative justification). Some humans approximate this—psychopaths who lack capacity for genuine practical reasoning, people in advanced dementia. The shmagent isn't self-contradictory, just sub-rational.

So Enoch's challenge stands: Why should someone become (or remain) a rational agent rather than a shmagent?

### 5a.1.3 The Deeper Response

The question "Why be an agent?" admits of three interpretations:

**Interpretation 1: Asking for external justification**
"From standpoint outside agency, give me reason to be an agent."

This question cannot be answered—not because constructivism fails, but because the demand is incoherent. There is no standpoint outside practical reasoning from which to evaluate practical reasoning. This isn't failure of constructivism but recognition of its limits.

Analogy: "From standpoint outside logic, give me logical reason to be logical." This cannot be done, but logic isn't thereby undermined. Some frameworks are constitutive of inquiry itself and cannot be justified externally.

**Interpretation 2: Asking for instrumental reason**
"What benefit does agency provide that shmagency doesn't?"

This has answers: Rational agents can plan, coordinate with others, sustain projects over time, revise strategies based on reflection. Shmagents lack these capacities. If you value these goods, you have instrumental reason to develop agency.

But this response is limited: it only binds those who already value planning, coordination, etc. For someone content with shmagency, no instrumental argument compels.

**Interpretation 3: The existential question**
"I find myself capable of rational agency. Should I exercise this capacity or suppress it?"

This is the real question. And here constructivism has resources. You possess capacity for practical reasoning—you can step back from impulses, evaluate options, act for reasons. The question is whether to exercise or atrophy this capacity.

**The response**: Once you possess the capacity, failing to exercise it is a kind of self-betrayal. You have ability to live as self-conscious agent responsive to reasons, and you choose to live as mere responder to impulses. This is possible but represents failure to realize your distinctive human capacities.

This is not external justification (Interpretation 1) or instrumental justification (Interpretation 2). It is recognition that for beings with our capacities, agency is the appropriate mode of existence. To refuse it is not logically contradictory but existentially problematic—refusing to be what you are capable of being.

### 5a.1.4 The Concession

I concede that this response will not satisfy someone seeking external, non-circular justification for valuing rational agency. No such justification exists. But this is limitation of the demand, not failure of constructivism.

Every normative framework must start somewhere. Utilitarianism starts from: suffering is bad. Kantianism starts from: rationality is authoritative. Constructivism starts from: you are a rational agent; this is what agency requires.

The question is which starting point is most defensible. I argue constructivism's starting point—the standpoint of practical deliberation—is superior because:
1. It begins where we actually are (deliberating)
2. It doesn't require metaphysical commitments beyond naturalism
3. It's revisable through pragmatic testing
4. It connects normativity to human capacities rather than abstract entities

But I acknowledge: This won't convince a committed shmagent. It will only convince those already engaged in practical deliberation—which, fortunately, includes nearly all humans nearly all of the time.

## 5a.2 The Constitutive Ambiguity

### 5a.2.1 The Objection

Critics argue that "constitutive of agency" is ambiguous between:

**(a) Necessary for being an agent at all** (strong claim)

**(b) Necessary for being a good/rational agent** (weak claim)

If (a): The claim is empirically false. Plenty of incoherent, selfish, recognition-denying people are still agents. They deliberate, act on reasons, have practical identities.

If (b): Normativity is smuggled in. Saying someone is "bad agent" presupposes standards of good agency that need justification.

This ambiguity threatens the framework. If constitutive norms are only norms for good agency (b), we haven't grounded normativity—we've presupposed it.

### 5a.2.2 My Clarification

I opt for a middle position: **constitutive of minimally rational agency**.

There are degrees of agency. At one extreme: fully rational agents who deliberate coherently, recognize others, maintain stable practical identities, act for reasons they reflectively endorse. At the other extreme: shmagents who merely respond to stimuli without practical reasoning.

In between: **deficient agents**—beings with capacity for practical reason who exercise it poorly or inconsistently. The psychopath who instrumentally reasons but can't recognize others' moral status. The self-deceived person who maintains contradictory commitments. The weak-willed person who acts against their own reflective judgments.

**My claim**: Some norms are constitutive of minimal rational agency—the threshold below which you're not reasoning practically at all. Other norms distinguish better from worse practical reasoning within the space of agency.

**Examples of constitutive norms** (minimal rationality):
- **Minimal coherence**: You can't explicitly affirm P and not-P simultaneously
- **Minimal consistency**: Your actions must reflect some stable commitments (not random)
- **Minimal recognition**: You must treat some considerations as reasons (not mere causes)

**Examples of non-constitutive norms** (better agency):
- **Full coherence**: All your beliefs form reflective equilibrium
- **Full consistency**: You never experience weakness of will
- **Full recognition**: You recognize all persons as equal moral agents

The first set is what I rely on. Violating them doesn't make you "bad agent" in normative sense—it makes you not-quite-agent, someone whose practical reasoning is so deficient you're barely reasoning at all.

### 5a.2.3 The Nazi Problem Revisited

Return to the Nazi objection. Can a Nazi be "minimally rational agent" by these standards?

**Yes and no**. A Nazi can satisfy minimal coherence and consistency. Their problem is different: **they fail minimal recognition in extended sense**.

Minimal recognition requires treating *some* considerations as genuinely normative reasons (not mere desires). But once you grant normative force to considerations at all, you must explain why some count and others don't.

The Nazi says: "Aryan flourishing is a reason; Jewish suffering is not." But what grounds this asymmetry? Not biological facts (racial science is false). Not divine command (the Nazi is typically not religious). Not pure preference (they claim moral authority, not mere taste).

The only available answer: "They count as reasons because they're *ours*—our people, our values, our community." But this is **performative contradiction**. If normative force derives from "being ours," then other communities' reasons have equal standing in their context. The Nazi must either:
- Accept relativism (Jewish communities rightly value Jewish flourishing from their perspective)
- Claim some considerations are objectively normative independent of community

If they accept relativism, they lose moral authority to impose on others. If they claim objective normativity, they need account of what grounds it—and any plausible account (suffering matters, rational agents matter, human capacities matter) will undermine their position.

**So**: Minimally rational agency doesn't directly prohibit Nazi practical identity, but it generates pressures that undermine it upon reflection. Add pragmatic testing (Nazi states produce massive suffering and fail spectacularly), and the identity becomes untenable.

### 5a.2.4 The Concession

I concede this is more modest than Korsgaard's full framework. She argues that recognition of all persons as ends-in-themselves follows directly from the structure of rational agency. I'm less confident.

What I defend: Some recognition is constitutive of minimal agency. Equal recognition is not directly constitutive but emerges from reflection on what grounds normative force + pragmatic testing of which recognition-structures are sustainable.

This is weaker but more defensible. It won't immediately convince Nazis—but it provides grounds for critique and tools for showing why their position is problematic.

## 5a.3 Engaging Street, Railton, and Schroeder

### 5a.3.1 Street's Challenge to Constructivism

Sharon Street distinguishes versions of constructivism ("What Is Constructivism in Ethics and Metaethics?", 2010). She identifies the key challenge: **What constrains the construction?**

If we "construct" values through practical deliberation, what makes some constructions correct and others incorrect? Without constraints, constructivism collapses into relativism or nihilism.

Korsgaard's answer: The structure of practical reason itself provides constraints. Only certain self-constitutions are coherent.

Street's worry: This either:
- Makes normativity trivial (anything coherent is normative)
- Smuggles in substantive norms (coherence + something else grounds normativity)

**My response**: I embrace the second horn but show it's not smuggling—it's expanding.

Pragmatic existentialism adds constraints beyond coherence:
1. **Pragmatic constraint**: Values must enable sustainable agency and flourishing (tested empirically)
2. **Social constraint**: Values must be sustainable through collective deliberation
3. **Recognition constraint**: Values must respect the agency of others (emerges from reflection + pragmatic testing)

These aren't arbitrary additions. They emerge from taking seriously that:
- We're embodied creatures (pragmatic constraint)
- We're social creatures (social constraint)
- We're creatures among other such creatures (recognition constraint)

Street can object that I'm still "smuggling," but I argue these constraints are defensible extensions of taking agency seriously in its full context—not pure practical reason but practically reasoning creatures in social world.

### 5a.3.2 Railton's Naturalist Alternative

Peter Railton offers sophisticated naturalist realism as alternative to constructivism ("Facts, Values, and Norms"). He argues we can reduce moral properties to natural properties (what would be rationally approved of by an ideally informed, fully rational agent under ideal conditions).

This avoids constructivism's problems by grounding values in natural facts about rational approval. But it faces its own objections:

**Against Railton**: His "ideally informed, fully rational" agent is too idealized. No such agent exists. Moreover, different idealizations yield different results. Why these idealizing conditions rather than others?

**My advantage**: Constructivism starts from actual agents deliberating under actual constraints. We don't need to specify ideal conditions—we test through experience what works.

Railton's framework is more metaphysically ambitious (claiming values are natural properties) but less epistemically accessible (we can't know what ideal agent would approve). Constructivism + pragmatism is metaphysically modest but epistemically tractable.

### 5a.3.3 Schroeder's Hypothetical Reasons

Mark Schroeder ("Slaves of the Passions") develops sophisticated Humean account: reasons are facts that explain why you should (given your desires). All practical reasons are ultimately hypothetical.

This seems to avoid constructivism's problems. No constitutive norms, no question-begging starting points—just: given what you want, here's what you have reason to do.

**Against Schroeder**: This can't explain categorical normativity. Why should I develop different desires? Why should I care about coherence if I don't?

Schroeder bites bullet: maybe all normativity is hypothetical. But this leaves us unable to criticize someone's deepest commitments. If someone fundamentally doesn't care about others, Schroeder can only say: "Given your desires, you have no reason to." This is unacceptable.

**My response**: Some norms must be categorical (binding regardless of desires) because they're constitutive of practical agency itself. Schroeder's framework describes norms for agents who already care about reasons—but can't explain why to care about reasons at all.

### 5a.3.4 The Pattern

Each alternative to constructivism either:
- Requires more metaphysical machinery (Railton's ideal observer)
- Collapses normativity into hypothetical imperatives (Schroeder)
- Faces same grounding problems constructivism does (various forms of realism)

Constructivism + pragmatism offers attractive middle path: Normatively robust enough to ground genuine obligations, metaphysically modest enough to avoid spooky entities, epistemically tractable enough to guide action.

The critics are right that it faces challenges. But it faces fewer challenges than alternatives, and the challenges it faces are manageable.

## 5a.4 Independent Arguments Beyond Korsgaard

If Korsgaard's full framework fails, can pragmatic existentialism survive? Yes—because core insights don't depend on her complete system.

### 5a.4.1 The Evolutionary-Pragmatist Foundation

Alternative grounding: Values emerged through evolutionary and cultural processes as solutions to coordination problems faced by social creatures.

**The argument**:
1. Humans evolved as social, cooperative species
2. Cooperation requires norms (reciprocity, fairness, promise-keeping)
3. These norms enabled survival and flourishing
4. Cultural evolution refined and expanded them
5. We inherit normative frameworks that proved successful

This grounds normativity in natural history rather than pure practical reason. It's less philosophically elegant than Korsgaard but more empirically grounded.

**The pragmatist addition**: We continue testing and refining norms through experience. Some norms that evolved for ancestral environments need revision. Some prove more sustainable than others. This is ongoing empirical inquiry, not a priori deduction.

This framework explains:
- Why norms feel binding (evolutionary inheritance + social conditioning)
- Why some norms are cross-cultural (convergent evolution toward similar solutions)
- Why norms are revisable (cultural evolution continues)
- How to evaluate norms (pragmatic testing)

### 5a.4.2 The Social Contract Tradition

Alternative grounding: Values emerge from implicit agreements among agents who must coordinate behavior.

Drawing on Gauthier, Scanlon, and Darwall: We need frameworks for mutual accountability. Given that we're social creatures who affect each other, we require principles all can accept.

This grounds recognition requirement: If I expect you to respect my agency, I must respect yours. This is not metaphysical necessity but practical necessity of social existence.

The advantage: This doesn't require Korsgaard's strong constitutive claims. It just requires accepting that we're social beings who need coordination principles.

### 5a.4.3 The Integration

My actual position integrates multiple foundations:

**Primary**: Korsgaard's self-constitution (provides richest account of how values emerge from agency)

**Secondary**: Evolutionary-pragmatist grounding (explains why we're constituted as we are)

**Tertiary**: Social contract (supplements recognition requirement)

If Korsgaard's framework fails, the secondary and tertiary foundations remain. This makes pragmatic existentialism more resilient than pure Korsgaardian constructivism.

## 5a.5 Why Constructivism Despite the Problems

After acknowledging all these challenges, why persist with constructivism at all?

### 5a.5.1 The Alternatives Are Worse

**Moral realism**: Posits objective moral facts existing independent of human attitudes. But:
- Metaphysically extravagant (what are these facts?)
- Epistemologically mysterious (how do we know them?)
- Doesn't fit naturalism (where are they in scientific worldview?)

**Expressivism/Non-cognitivism**: Moral claims express attitudes rather than state facts. But:
- Struggles to explain moral reasoning and argument
- Can't account for moral progress
- Makes ethics seem arbitrary or non-serious

**Error theory**: No moral facts exist; all moral claims are false. But:
- Unlivable (no one actually lives as moral nihilist)
- Self-undermining (makes philosophical practice itself pointless)
- Ignores that we're creatures who need normative frameworks

**Relativism**: Values are relative to cultures or individuals. But:
- Can't criticize oppression across cultures
- Makes moral progress unintelligible
- Too permissive (allows clearly problematic practices)

**Constructivism's advantage**: Preserves normative force without metaphysical extravagance, grounds values in human agency without arbitrariness, allows for moral progress while acknowledging cultural variation.

Yes, it faces challenges. But they're manageable compared to alternatives' fatal flaws.

### 5a.5.2 The Pragmatist Amendment Helps

Korsgaard's pure constructivism is too rationalist—it tries to derive everything from structure of practical reason. This is over-ambitious and generates the problems critics identify.

Adding pragmatist elements helps:
- Values are tested empirically, not derived a priori
- Fallibilism about all claims
- Social deliberation refines understanding
- Evolutionary and cultural context matter

This "constructivism-plus" is more modest but more defensible. It loses some of Korsgaard's elegance but gains empirical tractability.

### 5a.5.3 The Honest Acknowledgment

I concede: Constructivism doesn't provide the airtight, question-stopping justification some philosophers seek. It starts from agency and shows what agency requires, but it can't justify caring about agency from neutral standpoint.

This is not failure—it's honesty about philosophy's limits. Every framework must start somewhere. The question is which starting point is most defensible given our actual situation: embodied, social, rational creatures deliberating about how to live.

Constructivism starts from that situation rather than appealing to transcendent entities or denying normativity entirely. This is its strength, not its weakness.

## 5a.6 Summary: The Defensible Core

What survives this critical examination?

**Defensible claims**:
1. Some norms are constitutive of minimal rational agency
2. These norms include: minimal coherence, minimal consistency, some form of recognition
3. Additional norms emerge from pragmatic testing and social deliberation
4. This grounds ethics without transcendence or pure relativism
5. It's more defensible than alternatives despite challenges

**Concessions made**:
1. Can't convince someone who opts out of rational agency entirely
2. Can't derive equal recognition directly from pure practical reason (need pragmatic argument too)
3. Can't provide external justification for valuing agency
4. Must rely on multiple complementary foundations, not just Korsgaard
5. More modest than claiming to "solve" normative questions definitively

**The result**: A chastened but resilient constructivism suitable for pragmatic existentialism's purposes. Not philosophically invulnerable, but defensible and superior to alternatives.

Chapter 6 now proceeds with this more modest but more honest foundation established.
