# The Pragmatic Existentialist: Meaning, Ethics, and Agency After Absurdism

**A philosophical monograph for academic audiences**

## Overview

This book develops a systematic philosophy for living without transcendence by synthesizing existential phenomenology, Korsgaardian self-constitution, social constructivism, and pragmatist epistemology. It shows how to salvage Albert Camus's insights about meaninglessness while avoiding his fatal contradictions.

## Target Audience

- Academic philosophers (continental and analytic traditions)
- Graduate students in philosophy
- Advanced undergraduates studying existentialism, ethics, or meaning
- Scholars interested in bridges between philosophical traditions

## Core Argument

**The Problem**: Camus correctly diagnosed the absurd (meaning-seeking beings in meaningless universe) but prescribed incoherent response. His "revolt" cannot ground ethics—the ethical bootstrapping problem is fatal.

**The Solution**: Values emerge from the structure of rational agency itself (Korsgaard), are socially constituted through practices (MacIntyre), and are tested pragmatically by consequences (Dewey). This grounds ethics without either transcendence or arbitrariness.

**The Contribution**: First systematic philosophy AFTER absurdism's critique, resolving its contradictions while preserving phenomenological insights.

## Structure

### Part I: The Problem (Chapters 1-3)
- Camus's correct diagnosis of absurdity
- Absurdism's fatal contradictions
- Why existing alternatives (religious return, Sartre, analytics, pragmatism) fail

### Part II: Foundations (Chapters 4-6)
- Situated freedom (beyond Sartre's radical choice)
- Self-constitution ethics (grounding values in agency)
- Social constitution of meaning (practices and deliberation)

### Part III: Applications (Chapters 7-9)
- Living with purpose (work, love, parenting, suffering, mortality)
- Ethics in practice (concrete cases)
- The meaning crisis and its response

### Part IV: Philosophical Defense (Chapters 10-12)
- Naturalist metaethics
- Phenomenological-pragmatist methodology
- Objections and responses

## Key Contributions

1. **Resolution of ethical bootstrapping**: Shows how normativity emerges from agency structure without transcendence

2. **Integration of traditions**: Synthesizes continental phenomenology, analytic metaethics, and pragmatist epistemology

3. **Substantive differences from Sartre**: Not terminological revision but genuine philosophical divergences

4. **Response to meaning crisis**: Addresses both existential and social-structural dimensions

5. **Practical applicability**: Provides concrete guidance for living, not just theory

## Philosophical Commitments

- **Naturalism**: No transcendent entities; agency is natural phenomenon
- **Fallibilism**: All claims are revisable in light of experience
- **Social constitutionism**: Selfhood and values are socially constituted
- **Pragmatism**: Claims tested by consequences, not derived from foundations
- **Phenomenological sensitivity**: Attentive to lived experience

## Original Contributions to Literature

This work occupies unique space:
- Analytics on meaning (Metz, Wolf, Nagel) don't engage Camus seriously
- Continentals continue within existentialism without resolving contradictions
- Pragmatists dismiss existential questions as pseudo-problems
- No one has attempted this synthesis
