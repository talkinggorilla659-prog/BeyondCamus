# Chapter 8: Ethics in Practice: Concrete Cases

Chapter 5 developed ethical theory; Chapter 7 applied it to life domains. This chapter works through specific ethical dilemmas, showing how pragmatic existentialism provides guidance where traditional frameworks flounder. I focus on cases where meaninglessness seems most threatening: ethical conflicts without right answers, moral uncertainty, cultural disagreement, and tragic choices.

## 8.1 The Methodology

Pragmatic existentialism approaches ethical cases through:
1. **Practical identity analysis**: What identities are at stake?
2. **Recognition requirement**: Does action respect others' agency?
3. **Consequentialist test**: What outcomes for flourishing?
4. **Coherence check**: Can I reflectively endorse this?
5. **Social test**: Does my community's deliberation support this?
6. **Revisability**: Am I willing to reconsider given new evidence?

This is not algorithmic—real cases involve weighing incommensurable values. But it provides structure for deliberation.

## 8.2 Case 1: The Demanding Job

**Scenario**: You have opportunity for high-status, high-paying position requiring 70-hour weeks, extensive travel, constant availability. This would advance your career significantly but leave little time for partnership and children. Your partner is ambivalent. How do you decide?

**Traditional frameworks:**
- **Utilitarian**: Calculate aggregate welfare—impossible given uncertainties
- **Kantian**: Does maxim universalize? Both choices seem universalizable
- **Virtue**: Which character traits should you develop? Ambitious professional? Devoted partner? Both seem virtuous

**Pragmatic existentialist analysis:**

*Practical identities*: This job requires constituting yourself primarily as professional. Other identities (partner, parent) become secondary. Is this the person you want to be?

*Recognition*: Does accepting this job respect your partner's agency? They are ambivalent—have you genuinely deliberated together, or are you rationalizing predetermined choice?

*Consequences*: What happens to relationships if you accept? To career if you decline? These are empirical questions requiring honest assessment.

*Coherence*: Can you reflectively endorse the practical identities this choice constitutes? Or will you later regret prioritizing career over relationship?

*Social*: What do communities you trust advise? Not to follow blindly but to test your reasoning against others'.

*Revisability*: If you accept and it damages relationships, can you leave? If structural features of this career require similar trade-offs continuously, is this sustainable?

**The answer**: Depends on your situated values. But the framework clarifies what is at stake—not financial calculus but identity-constitution. You are choosing what kind of agent to be. There is no cosmic right answer, but there is *your* answer emerging from reflective deliberation about practical identities you endorse.

## 8.3 Case 2: Truth-Telling and Harm

**Scenario**: Your friend's artistic work is objectively mediocre. They are considering quitting secure job to pursue art full-time and ask your honest assessment. You believe this would be financially catastrophic mistake. Do you tell the truth?

**Considerations:**

*Practical identities*: As friend, you are committed to their flourishing. But which serves flourishing—honesty that might save them from mistake, or encouragement that respects their autonomy?

*Recognition*: Your friend is agent. Lying treats them as unable to handle truth. But brutal honesty without sensitivity might be instrumentalizing too.

*The pragmatic test*: What are likely consequences of each choice? If you lie and they quit, they suffer financially—and may resent your dishonesty later. If you tell truth harshly, you might damage friendship. If you tell truth compassionately, you give them information to make informed decision.

*The nuanced answer*: Express honest assessment while respecting their agency. "I care about you and want to be honest. I think your current work hasn't reached professional level yet. That doesn't mean you couldn't with more development, but quitting your job now seems risky. Can we think through this together?"

This avoids both crude honesty and protective dishonesty. It treats friend as agent capable of hearing difficult truth while offering support.

**The general principle**: When duties conflict (honesty vs. compassion), we deliberate by considering practical identities, consequences, and whether our response respects agency. No formula resolves all cases, but framework structures reasoning.

## 8.4 Case 3: Political Compromise

**Scenario**: You are political organizer working for racial justice. Your coalition can pass modest reform (helps but insufficient) if you compromise on language that some members find unacceptably weak. Perfect bill that addresses root causes has no chance of passing. Do you compromise?

**The absolutist position** (like early Camus): Maintain purity. Refuse compromise. Accept no half-measures.

**The pragmatist position** (like late Sartre): Accept any compromise that advances cause, even marginally.

**Pragmatic existentialist analysis:**

*Political identity*: Are you organizer who achieves small wins or activist who maintains moral witness? Both are legitimate practical identities, but they generate different obligations.

*Consequences*: Modest reform helps real people now. Perfect bill that fails helps no one. But modest reform might reduce pressure for more fundamental change. Which outcome better advances agency and flourishing?

*Social deliberation*: What does your community—especially those most affected—decide? Their input should carry weight (not be determinative, but heavily weighted).

*Symbolic dimension*: Sometimes maintaining witness matters even when ineffective. Civil rights activists who refused compromise often lost tactical battles but won strategic ones by clarifying moral issues.

*The situated answer*: Depends on empirical assessment of consequences and community's deliberation. There is no universal rule. In some contexts, compromise advances justice incrementally. In others, it entrenches injustice by making it tolerable.

The framework helps by clarifying what factors matter and how to weigh them. But political judgment cannot be reduced to algorithm—it requires practical wisdom developed through experience.

## 8.5 Case 4: Cultural Practices

**Scenario**: You are physician treating patient from culture where male elders make medical decisions for family. The patient is adult woman who privately tells you she wants treatment her father forbids. Respecting her autonomy conflicts with respecting their cultural practice. How do you proceed?

**Cultural relativism**: Respect cultural practices—let father decide.

**Liberal universalism**: Individual autonomy trumps culture—follow patient's wishes.

**Pragmatic existentialist analysis:**

*Agency*: The woman is agent. Cultural practices that deny agency to adult persons are problematic regardless of origin. This is not Western imperialism—it's recognition that agency is constitutive of personhood across cultures.

*Recognition*: The father may believe he is protecting his daughter's wellbeing. His practical identity as father includes decision-making. But this identity becomes problematic when it denies his daughter's agency.

*Social practices*: Cultural practices sustain meaning, but not all practices are worth sustaining. Those that systematically deny agency to category of persons (women, certain castes, ethnic minorities) are oppressive.

*The response*: Honor patient's autonomous decision while exploring whether family dynamics can shift through conversation. Perhaps father can come to see respecting his daughter's choices as better expression of protective concern than overriding them. If not, patient's agency takes precedence.

**The principle**: Cultural practices deserve respect, but not uncritical deference. We evaluate practices by whether they sustain or undermine agency for all participants. This is not imposing external values but applying recognition requirement consistently.

## 8.6 Case 5: Environmental Obligations

**Scenario**: Your comfortable lifestyle contributes to climate change that will primarily harm future generations and poor nations. Are you obligated to radically reduce consumption even though individual impact is negligible?

**The free rider problem**: If individual impact is negligible, why sacrifice? Others' actions determine outcomes. "My consumption doesn't matter" seems rational.

**Pragmatic existentialist analysis:**

*Practical identity*: Do you constitute yourself as responsible agent attentive to consequences of your actions, or as pure consumer unconcerned with collective effects? The choice is not primarily about climate impact but about who you are.

*Recognition*: Future persons and distant others are agents whose flourishing matters. Ignoring their interests because they are temporally or spatially distant fails recognition requirement.

*Collective practices*: Individual action is symbolic and practical. Practically, it contributes marginally to solutions. Symbolically, it expresses values and potentially influences others. Both matter.

*Social obligation*: You are embedded in practices that produce climate change. Benefiting from unjust system while refusing responsibility is complicity. Not because cosmic law condemns it, but because it fails solidarity requirement of socially constituted agency.

**The response**: Moderate consumption reduction (avoiding worst excesses) combined with political action (supporting systemic change). Individual purity is insufficient (Camus's error), but totally ignoring individual responsibility is also wrong. The balance is pragmatic—what contribution can you make that sustains your practical identities while respecting others' agency?

## 8.7 Case 6: The Dementia Patient

**Scenario**: Your parent has advanced dementia. They are sometimes lucid, sometimes not. When lucid, they beg you not to place them in care facility. When not lucid, they are danger to themselves. They previously told you they would never want to live "like this" but refuse to acknowledge that is their current state. What do you do?

**Autonomy-based ethics**: Respect their current wishes (refuse facility).

**Welfarist ethics**: Maximize their wellbeing (place in facility).

**Pragmatic existentialist analysis:**

*Agency disruption*: Dementia disrupts agency—not eliminating person but fragmenting practical identity over time. Your parent is not fully autonomous agent now but neither are they mere object.

*Recognition*: Honor both their prior values (when fully autonomous) and current preferences (as diminished agent). These conflict. No framework resolves this without remainder.

*Your practical identity*: You are son/daughter committed to their wellbeing. This identity involves both respecting autonomy and protecting when they cannot protect themselves.

*The tragic dimension*: This is genuinely tragic choice. Either option involves harm. Respecting current refusal risks their injury. Overriding it disrespects diminished but real autonomy. There is no right answer that avoids moral cost.

**The response**: Make decision based on careful assessment of risks, consultation with medical professionals, and consideration of their lifelong values—then accept moral remainder. You will second-guess this decision. That is appropriate response to genuine tragedy. Pragmatic existentialism does not eliminate tragedy, but it clarifies why some choices are tragic (incommensurable goods in conflict) rather than simply difficult.

## 8.8 General Lessons

These cases illustrate several features of pragmatic existentialist ethics:

**1. No algorithms**: Ethical reasoning involves judgment, not calculation. Framework structures deliberation but does not mechanize it.

**2. Incommensurability**: Some values cannot be compared on single scale. Choosing between them involves practical wisdom, not optimization.

**3. Situatedness matters**: Abstract principles must be applied to concrete circumstances. Same principle generates different actions in different situations.

**4. Social deliberation**: We test our reasoning against others', especially those affected. This is not outsourcing judgment but refining it.

**5. Tragic remainder**: Some choices involve genuine loss regardless of decision. Acknowledging this is maturity, not failure.

**6. Revisability**: We remain fallible. Decisions can be reconsidered if circumstances change or we learn we were wrong.

**7. Identity-constitution**: Many ethical questions are really questions about what kind of agent to be. This shifts focus from "what should I do?" to "who should I become?"

## 8.9 The Advantage Over Traditional Frameworks

Traditional ethical theories (utilitarian, Kantian, virtue) seek universal principles that determine right action. They fail in practice because:
- Consequences are uncertain (utilitarian problem)
- Maxims conflict (Kantian problem)
- Virtues point in different directions (virtue problem)
- Cultural contexts vary (application problem)

Pragmatic existentialism avoids these problems by:
- Starting from situated agency rather than abstract principles
- Incorporating consequences without reducing ethics to calculation
- Recognizing tragic conflicts without pretending they have solutions
- Grounding ethics in agency itself rather than cosmic values
- Maintaining fallibilism about all judgments

This does not make ethics easier—it makes it honest. Real ethical life involves uncertainty, conflict, tragedy, and fallibility. Any framework claiming to eliminate these oversimplifies.

## 8.10 The Religious Objection

Religious ethics offers apparent certainty: God commands X, so do X. Why is pragmatic existentialism preferable?

Because even religious ethics faces interpretation problems. Texts conflict. Communities disagree. Circumstances change. Real religious ethical reasoning involves all the complexities described above—only with added claim that answers come from transcendent source.

Moreover, for those of us who cannot believe transcendent source exists, religious ethics is unavailable. We must do ethics from within human standpoint. Pragmatic existentialism shows this is possible.

Chapter 9 now addresses why pragmatic existentialism responds to contemporary meaning crisis where alternatives fail.
