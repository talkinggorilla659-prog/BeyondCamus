## Core Thesis

Absurdism correctly diagnoses the fundamental human condition—the collision between our meaning-seeking nature and the universe's indifference—but prescribes philosophically incoherent medicine. This book builds a rigorous alternative by synthesizing pragmatist epistemology, Korsgaardian self-constitution, and social constructivism to salvage absurdism's phenomenological insights while resolving its fatal contradictions, particularly the ethical bootstrapping problem.

## Target Audience

Academic philosophers, graduate students in philosophy, advanced undergraduates in continental and analytic traditions. Assumes familiarity with Camus, Sartre, basic metaethics, and contemporary philosophy of meaning.

## Philosophical Contribution

- First systematic philosophy AFTER absurdism's critique
- Resolution of ethical bootstrapping without transcendence or nihilism
- Novel synthesis of continental phenomenology and analytic rigor
- Bridge between existentialism, pragmatism, and constructivism
- Response to 21st-century meaning crisis with academic foundation
