# Chapter 9: The Meaning Crisis and Its Response

Philosophers are not merely describing abstract problems. We live in a time of pervasive meaning crisis—rising rates of depression, anxiety, suicide, loneliness, and nihilistic despair. John Vervaeke's diagnosis of "meaning crisis" captures something real about contemporary existence (*Awakening from the Meaning Crisis*). This chapter diagnoses the crisis and shows why pragmatic existentialism responds where alternatives fail.

## 9.1 Diagnosing the Crisis

### 9.1.1 The Symptoms

Empirical indicators suggest widespread meaning deficit:
- Depression and anxiety at historic highs, especially among young people
- "Deaths of despair" (suicide, drug overdose, alcohol) increasing in developed nations
- Declining participation in religious, civic, and community organizations
- Reported loneliness and social isolation increasing despite digital connectivity
- Pervasive sense of nihilism, purposelessness, and alienation in cultural discourse

These are not merely individual pathologies but social-structural phenomena requiring explanation.

### 9.1.2 The Collapse of Transcendent Frameworks

Pre-modern societies provided cosmic meaning through religious narratives. Life had purpose given by God. Suffering was redemptive. Death led to afterlife. Social roles were divinely ordained. Individual existence mattered cosmically.

Modernity dismantled these frameworks through:
- **Scientific revolution**: Universe governed by natural law, not divine will
- **Enlightenment**: Reason replaces revelation as authority
- **Industrial revolution**: Social roles determined by economy, not tradition
- **Pluralism**: Exposure to multiple incompatible worldviews undermines each

For many, transcendent frameworks became intellectually untenable. But nothing adequate replaced them. The result is meaning void.

### 9.1.3 The Corruption of Practices

Even as transcendent meaning collapsed, practices that sustained immanent meaning eroded:

**Economic colonization**: Market logic invaded domains previously governed by internal goods. Education became credentialing, medicine became business, art became commodity, relationships became transactions.

**Institutional decay**: Civic organizations, religious communities, labor unions—all declined. These practices sustained collective meaning and social connection.

**Attention economy**: Digital technologies commodify attention, fragmenting engagement needed for deep involvement in practices with internal goods.

**Acceleration**: Social change occurs so rapidly that practices cannot stabilize. Careers that required lifetime mastery become obsolete. Communities disperse. Traditions lose transmission.

The result: people lack access to practices that enable meaning even when they desire it.

### 9.1.4 The Individualism Problem

Modern culture emphasizes individual autonomy, self-actualization, and personal freedom. These are genuine goods. But extreme individualism undermines social conditions of meaning.

Meaning requires practices sustained by communities. Purely individualist frameworks (like Sartre's) cannot generate or sustain such practices. We end up with atomized individuals seeking meaning in isolation—which is impossible because meaning is inherently social.

Consumer culture exploits this, promising individual fulfillment through products. But consumption cannot provide meaning (no internal goods, no genuine practices). The result is dissatisfaction and renewed searching, which consumer culture redirects to more consumption.

## 9.2 Inadequate Responses

### 9.2.1 Religious Return

Some respond to meaning crisis by returning to religious frameworks. This works for those who can genuinely believe. But for many, belief is no longer possible after critical reflection.

Moreover, fundamentalist versions of religious return often involve bad faith—forced belief, epistemic authoritarianism, refusal of honest inquiry. These violate intellectual integrity.

Liberal religion may avoid fundamentalism but faces different problem: if religious claims are reinterpreted as metaphors rather than truths, what grounds them? Why these metaphors rather than others?

### 9.2.2 Consumerism and Distraction

Dominant cultural response is distraction: entertainment, consumption, constant stimulation. Keep busy enough to avoid existential questions.

This "works" for some but produces hollow flourishing. Distraction is not meaning. Eventually questions resurface—often in midlife crisis or when confronting mortality.

Moreover, distraction strategy is psychologically costly. It requires constant effort to avoid reflection and produces anxiety when distraction fails.

### 9.2.3 Therapeutic Culture

Mental health framework treats meaning crisis as individual pathology requiring therapy, medication, or self-care.

Therapy helps many people and is sometimes necessary. But it cannot resolve social-structural meaning deficit. If the problem is erosion of meaning-sustaining practices, individual therapy is insufficient. We need social reconstruction, not just individual adjustment.

Medicalizing existential questions also risks pathologizing normal human experiences. Not all meaninglessness is depression. Some is appropriate response to social conditions that genuinely undermine meaning.

### 9.2.4 New Age Spirituality

Some seek meaning through eclectically appropriated spiritual practices—meditation, yoga, psychedelics, energy work, etc.

These practices can provide genuine benefits. But consumer spiritual marketplace often commodifies them, extracting practices from traditions that gave them meaning. The result is superficial engagement lacking depth of genuine practice.

Moreover, New Age spirituality often involves epistemic carelessness—accepting claims without evidence, magical thinking, conspiracy theories. This sacrifices intellectual integrity.

### 9.2.5 Political Ideologies

Some find meaning through total political commitment—whether to social justice movements, nationalism, or revolutionary ideology.

Politics can provide genuine meaning when oriented to internal goods of democratic practice. But ideological commitment as meaning-substitute is problematic:

It often requires epistemic closure (cannot acknowledge ambiguity or contrary evidence). It generates tribal identity that refuses recognition to outgroups. It can justify violence in service of transcendent political goals. These are versions of the problems Camus identified.

## 9.3 Why Pragmatic Existentialism Responds

### 9.3.1 Intellectual Honesty

Pragmatic existentialism does not require belief in claims we cannot defend. It begins from honest confrontation with meaninglessness—universe offers no cosmic purpose. This is starting point, not conclusion to avoid.

For those who cannot believe in transcendence, this honesty is prerequisite for any viable response. We cannot base meaning on foundations we reject. Pragmatic existentialism starts where we are: finite beings in meaningless universe seeking meaning anyway.

### 9.3.2 Practical Guidance

Unlike absurdism (which provides phenomenology but incoherent prescription) or analytics (which provide theory but limited application), pragmatic existentialism offers concrete guidance:

- How to choose work that engages capacities and contributes to practices
- How to sustain relationships through identity-constitution and mutual recognition
- How to raise children while transmitting values and developing autonomy
- How to make major decisions through deliberation about practical identities
- How to face suffering, mortality, and tragedy without false consolation

This is philosophy for living, not just for theorizing.

### 9.3.3 Social Dimension

Pragmatic existentialism recognizes meaning is social. It directs attention to:
- Building and sustaining practices with internal goods
- Resisting corruption of practices by market logic
- Creating communities that support meaningful engagement
- Political action to protect conditions of meaning

This addresses social-structural dimension of meaning crisis, not just individual psychology.

### 9.3.4 Psychological Sustainability

The framework is livable. It does not require:
- Constant consciousness of absurdity (Camus's exhausting demand)
- Perpetual anxiety about radical choice (Sartre's burden)
- Pretending to believe what you don't (religious bad faith)
- Constant distraction from existential questions (consumer solution)

It allows periods of engagement (losing yourself in projects) and periodic reflection (stepping back to evaluate). This rhythm is natural to human psychology.

### 9.3.5 Fallibilism

Pragmatic existentialism maintains fallibilism about all claims. Values are revisable, practical identities can change, communities can be wrong. This intellectual honesty appeals to those who cannot accept dogmatic frameworks.

But fallibilism does not collapse into relativism. Values bind even while revisable. Practical identities constitute agents even while changeable. This is how all rational belief works—tentative but real.

## 9.4 Building Meaning-Sustaining Practices

### 9.4.1 Individual Level

Concrete steps:
1. **Identify practices with internal goods**: What activities offer genuine excellence, mastery, contribution? Pursue those rather than merely external rewards.

2. **Develop practical identities**: Choose identities that engage your capacities and connect you to others. Invest in constituting yourself as that kind of agent.

3. **Create boundaries**: Protect time for practices from economic and digital colonization. Engagement requires sustained attention.

4. **Seek community**: Find or build communities organized around practices you value. Solitary meaning-seeking fails.

5. **Accept limitations**: You cannot pursue all goods. Choose and commit, accepting what must be foregone.

### 9.4.2 Community Level

Communities can:
1. **Organize around practices**: Form communities explicitly oriented to internal goods—maker spaces, mutual aid networks, study groups, athletic clubs, artistic collectives.

2. **Resist commodification**: Create spaces governed by norms other than market exchange—gift economies, commons, cooperative structures.

3. **Transmit practices**: Teach skills and values to next generation. Meaning requires transgenerational continuity.

4. **Support members**: Provide material and emotional support that enables engagement in practices despite economic pressure.

### 9.4.3 Political Level

Political action to protect meaning:
1. **Economic reform**: Support policies that enable people to engage in meaningful work—shorter hours, stronger unions, basic income, cooperative ownership.

2. **Institutional support**: Fund institutions that sustain practices—arts, education, research, civic organizations—recognizing these as infrastructure of meaning, not luxuries.

3. **Resist corruption**: Fight commodification of domains that should be governed by internal goods—education should cultivate understanding, not just credential; medicine should heal, not just profit.

4. **Protect attention**: Regulate attention economy—limit addictive design, restrict data harvesting, create spaces free from commercial manipulation.

5. **Democratic renewal**: Rebuild democratic practices at local level—participatory budgeting, community assemblies, cooperative decision-making.

## 9.5 The Vervaeke Connection

John Vervaeke diagnoses meaning crisis as arising from loss of "participatory knowing"—direct engaged understanding through practices, not just propositional knowledge. His solution involves "religion that's not a religion"—science-friendly framework providing transformative practices.

Pragmatic existentialism provides philosophical foundation for Vervaeke's project:
- Practices with internal goods (his "participatory knowing")
- Self-constitution through engagement (his "transformative knowing")
- Social dimension (his "communal knowing")
- Naturalistic framework (his "science-friendly" requirement)
- Without transcendent metaphysics (his "not a religion" constraint)

Where Vervaeke draws on cognitive science and contemplative traditions, I provide ethical and political philosophy. The projects are complementary.

## 9.6 The Uniqueness Claim

Why think pragmatic existentialism specially addresses meaning crisis? Many philosophers work on meaning.

The distinctive contribution is synthesis:
- **Existential honesty** about meaninglessness (from Camus)
- **Rigorous ethical theory** grounding values in agency (from Korsgaard)
- **Social constructivism** recognizing meaning is collective (from Hegel, MacIntyre)
- **Pragmatist epistemology** testing values by consequences (from Dewey, Rorty)
- **Practical applicability** for actual living (from applied ethics)
- **Political engagement** addressing structural causes (from critical theory)

No existing framework combines these. Analytics provide theory without existential force. Continentals provide phenomenology without rigorous foundations. Pragmatists dissolve problems without addressing lived crisis. Religious frameworks require transcendence. Self-help offers platitudes.

Pragmatic existentialism synthesizes what each tradition does well while avoiding what each does poorly.

## 9.7 Limitations and Humility

I do not claim pragmatic existentialism solves all problems or works for everyone. Philosophy cannot replace therapy for clinical depression, or economic security for those in poverty, or political liberation for the oppressed.

What it offers is framework for those capable of philosophical engagement who seek intellectual honesty combined with practical guidance. This is narrower than universal solution but broader than academic exercise.

The meaning crisis is real and worsening. Pragmatic existentialism is one response—not the only possible response, but a defensible one that takes seriously both the crisis's existential dimension and its social-structural causes.

Part IV now defends the position philosophically against strongest objections, clarifies its metaphysical commitments, and addresses whether this is merely Sartre or Kant repackaged.
