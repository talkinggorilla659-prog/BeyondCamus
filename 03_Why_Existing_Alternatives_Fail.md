# Chapter 3: Why Existing Alternatives Fail

Absurdism's contradictions are fatal. But before constructing a new framework, we must examine why existing alternatives prove inadequate. This chapter considers three main responses to meaninglessness—religious return, Sartrean existentialism, and analytic approaches—showing why each fails to provide what we need.

I do not dismiss these alternatives lightly. Each contains important insights. But each ultimately either (a) rejects the problem absurdism correctly identified, (b) reproduces absurdism's contradictions in different form, or (c) provides intellectually satisfying theory without practical applicability. The failures create space for pragmatic existentialism.

## 3.1 Religious Return and Philosophical Suicide

The most obvious response to meaninglessness is returning to religious or metaphysical frameworks that ground meaning transcendently. If the problem is absence of cosmic validation, restore it.

### 3.1.1 Why Camus Was Right to Reject This

Camus's condemnation of "philosophical suicide" is philosophically sound. The move to transcendent meaning is intellectually dishonest for those who cannot genuinely believe.

**The epistemic problem**: After Kant, Nietzsche, and Darwin, transcendent metaphysics faces insurmountable epistemic challenges. We cannot access transcendent reality beyond phenomenal experience (Kant). God is not obvious truth requiring mere acceptance but contested hypothesis requiring justification (Nietzsche). Our meaning-seeking drive is explicable naturalistically as evolutionary adaptation (Darwin). The hypothesis that transcendent meaning actually exists is both unjustified and explanatorily superfluous.

**The Kierkegaard problem**: Kierkegaard embraced absurdity as requiring faith *precisely because* it cannot be rationalized. But this makes the leap arbitrary. Why leap to Christian God rather than Zeus, Brahman, or FSM? If reason cannot adjudicate and one leaps anyway, the choice reflects cultural contingency, not philosophical justification.

**The bad faith problem**: Sartre argued that religious belief in modernity involves bad faith—self-deception about one's own freedom. I cannot genuinely believe in transcendent meaning if I recognize I am *choosing* to believe for pragmatic or emotional reasons. The reflective awareness that undermines naive faith cannot be erased through willpower.

**The diversity problem**: The existence of multiple incompatible religious frameworks undermines each. If transcendent meaning were real and accessible, we would expect convergence. Instead we find radical pluralism. This suggests meaning-frameworks are cultural constructions, not discoveries of transcendent truth.

### 3.1.2 The Pragmatic Defense

Some philosophers defend religious belief pragmatically: whether or not God exists, belief provides benefits (psychological comfort, moral community, life meaning). William James's "will to believe" exemplifies this approach (*The Will to Believe*).

But pragmatic defense concedes the epistemic point—we have no evidence for transcendence but believe anyway for benefits. This is precisely what Camus calls philosophical suicide: choosing comfort over truth.

Moreover, the pragmatic defense may be self-undermining. If I believe in God *because belief is useful*, not because God exists, do I genuinely believe? Belief motivated by consequences rather than evidence may not provide the psychological benefits that make belief useful in the first place.

### 3.1.3 Why Return Is Impossible for Many

Even if religious belief were philosophically defensible, it is psychologically unavailable to many. Modernity has produced consciousness that cannot simply return to pre-critical faith. As Charles Taylor documents (*A Secular Age*), the conditions of belief have changed. What once was obvious and natural—transcendent meaning—now requires effort and feels optional.

For those of us who cannot believe, religious return is not option. We must find alternative response to meaninglessness.

## 3.2 Sartrean Existentialism

If transcendent meaning is unavailable, perhaps we create our own. This is Sartre's response: radical freedom to construct meaning through authentic choice. Why does this fail to resolve absurdism's problems?

### 3.2.1 The Metaphysical Baggage

Sartre's existentialism depends on heavy ontological commitments that are philosophically contentious and arguably incoherent:

**Being-in-itself vs. being-for-itself**: Consciousness (*pour-soi*) is "nothingness" that introduces negation into being-in-itself (*en-soi*). This dualism generates notorious philosophical problems. How does nothingness affect being? How does consciousness interact with physical world? Sartre's phenomenological ontology is metaphysically extravagant.

**Consciousness as nothingness**: The claim that consciousness is literally nothing—defined only by what it is not—is phenomenologically questionable. When I am conscious of the tree, *something* is occurring. Reducing this to "nothing" seems to confuse intentional structure (consciousness is always consciousness *of* something other than itself) with metaphysical nature.

**Radical freedom**: Sartre insists "man is condemned to be free" (*Existentialism Is a Humanism*, 29). Even in extreme constraint (prisoner, tortured victim), we remain free because we choose our attitude. But this seems false. Constraint genuinely limits freedom. The difference between choosing among many options and choosing only one's emotional response is not trivial—it is the difference between freedom and unfreedom.

We do not need this metaphysical apparatus. The insights Sartre defends—we are not determined by essences, we bear responsibility for choices, we create meaning—can be articulated naturalistically without ontological dualism.

### 3.2.2 The Anxiety Problem

Sartre's radical freedom produces paralyzing anxiety. If I must create values ex nihilo, with no guidance from nature, reason, or tradition, how do I choose? Every choice is "absurd" in the sense that no prior framework constrains it. I can become anything, which means I lack any principle for deciding what to become.

Sartre acknowledges this: "The existentialist... thinks it very distressing that God does not exist, because all possibility of finding values in a heaven of ideas disappears along with Him... Dostoevsky said, 'If God didn't exist, everything would be possible.' That is the very starting point of existentialism. Indeed, everything is permissible if God does not exist" (*Existentialism Is a Humanism*, 28-29).

But if everything is permissible, on what basis do I choose? Sartre's answer—authentic choice in awareness of freedom—provides no content. Authenticity is purely formal criterion. The Nazi who authentically embraces Nazism in full awareness of freedom satisfies Sartre's criterion as much as the saint.

Sartre tries to escape this through universalizability: when I choose, I choose "for all humanity" because my choice creates an image of what humanity should be. But this Kantian move is inconsistent with his radical contingency. If I create values through arbitrary choice, how can my choice bind others? If values are my creation, they are *my* values, not universal obligations.

### 3.2.3 The Social Problem

Sartre's early existentialism is radically individualist. His famous line "hell is other people" (*No Exit*) captures a philosophy where others' gaze threatens my freedom by objectifying me. I am subject, they try to make me object. All relationships involve conflict.

This is phenomenologically false. Others do not merely threaten freedom—they enable it. I learn language from others, acquire values through community, develop identity through relationships. The self is socially constituted from the beginning, not an isolated consciousness that subsequently encounters others.

Sartre's later work (especially *Critique of Dialectical Reason*) recognizes this, attempting to develop social philosophy. But the integration is awkward. The metaphysics of radical individual freedom sits uneasily with recognition of social constitution. Sartre never successfully reconciles them.

### 3.2.4 The Commitment Problem

Sartre's framework makes sustained commitment problematic. If I am radically free at every moment, what binds me to past commitments? I chose to be father yesterday, but today I am free to abandon that identity. No essence ties me to fatherhood. The choice must be remade constantly.

Sartre recognizes this: "There is no human nature, since there is no God to conceive it. Not only is man what he conceives himself to be, but he is also only what he wills himself to be after this thrust toward existence" (*Existentialism Is a Humanism*, 22).

But this makes deep commitments—parenthood, marriage, vocation—psychologically untenable. These commitments require some stability of identity over time. I cannot be father "in the mode of not being" a father, constantly aware I freely chose this and could freely abandon it. The psychological reality of commitment involves internalization, not constant reflective distance.

### 3.2.5 The Bootstrapping Problem Redux

Despite appearances, Sartre faces the same ethical bootstrapping problem as Camus. If I create values ex nihilo, why am I obligated to honor them? If I chose to value justice yesterday, what obligates me to maintain that commitment today given my continued radical freedom?

Sartre might answer: I create obligation through choice. When I commit to justice, I bind myself to it. But this is mysterious. How does choice create obligation? If I can choose to create obligation, I can presumably choose to eliminate it. The obligation has no force beyond my continued willingness to honor it—which is not obligation at all but ongoing preference.

Real obligation involves constraint—something that binds me even when I prefer not to be bound. Sartre's self-created values cannot provide this. They collapse into preferences with no normative force.

## 3.3 Analytic Approaches

Contemporary analytic philosophers working on meaning in life—Thomas Nagel, Susan Wolf, Thaddeus Metz—provide more sophisticated frameworks than absurdism or existentialism. But they do not solve our problem.

### 3.3.1 Nagel's Ironic Detachment

In "The Absurd," Nagel agrees with Camus's diagnosis but rejects his prescription:

> "If sub specie aeternitatis there is no reason to believe that anything matters, then that doesn't matter either, and we can approach our absurd lives with irony instead of heroism or despair" (727).

Nagel's recommendation: recognize the absurd and be amused by it. Take life seriously from within while recognizing its ultimate meaninglessness from without. Maintain ironic distance.

But this is unsatisfying for several reasons:

**Practically useless**: Nagel provides no guidance for living. "Be ironically amused" is not framework for making decisions, choosing commitments, or responding to suffering. It is attitude one might adopt after having already resolved these questions some other way.

**Psychologically implausible**: Can one sustain ironic amusement through child's death, terminal diagnosis, or profound injustice? Nagel's stance works when life is comfortable. It offers nothing when stakes are high.

**Philosophically incomplete**: Nagel accepts that nothing matters ultimately but does not explain how anything matters proximately. How do I distinguish better from worse lives if I maintain ironic distance? The framework is purely negative.

### 3.3.2 Wolf's Fitting Fulfillment View

Susan Wolf offers more substantive account: "Meaning arises when subjective attraction meets objective attractiveness" (*Meaning in Life and Why It Matters*, 9-10). Meaningful life requires both (a) subjective engagement with projects one finds fulfilling and (b) objective worthiness of those projects.

This is progress. Wolf recognizes that purely subjective meaning (I find it fulfilling) is insufficient—the projects must actually be valuable. The sadist who takes pleasure in torture lacks meaning because torture is not objectively worthy, even if subjectively fulfilling.

But Wolf's account faces serious problems:

**The objectivity problem**: What grounds "objective attractiveness" if the universe is meaningless? Wolf suggests that some things just are valuable—great art, knowledge, love, moral good. But this seems to posit objective values without justification. Why are these objectively valuable? She provides no answer beyond intuition.

**The pluralism problem**: People disagree radically about what is objectively worthy. Is religious devotion objectively valuable or deluded? Is wealth creation worthy or morally problematic? Is political activism meaningful or futile? Wolf has no neutral procedure for resolving these disputes.

**The ground-level problem**: Even if some things are objectively valuable, why should *I* care? If I find torture fulfilling and don't recognize its wrongness, Wolf can say I lack meaning—but this won't motivate me. Her framework describes meaning from external perspective but provides no internal reason to pursue it.

### 3.3.3 Metz's Self-Transcendence

Thaddeus Metz develops sophisticated naturalist account: Meaning involves "orienting one's rational and evaluative capacities toward the good, the true, and the beautiful" (*Meaning in Life*, 10). Meaningful life transcends individual concerns, connecting with values that extend beyond the self.

This avoids Wolf's objectivity problem by grounding value naturalistically. What makes something "good, true, or beautiful" is its relationship to human flourishing, knowledge acquisition, or aesthetic experience—all naturalistically respectable.

But problems remain:

**The normativity problem**: Why should I orient toward good, true, and beautiful? If I prefer to pursue only my immediate interests, Metz can say my life lacks meaning—but so what? He hasn't given me reason to care about meaning so defined.

**The specification problem**: Different conceptions of good, true, and beautiful conflict. Is the good utilitarian maximization or virtue development? Is truth scientific knowledge or religious insight? Is beauty classical harmony or transgressive art? Metz's framework is too abstract to guide choice.

**The existential gap**: Metz provides theory of meaning but not framework for living with meaninglessness. He helps us identify meaningful lives but not how to construct them when we lack prior conviction about what matters.

### 3.3.4 The General Analytic Failure

These analytic approaches share a weakness: they theorize meaning from external perspective without addressing the existential crisis that motivates the question.

Someone experiencing existential despair—wondering whether anything matters, unable to invest in projects, feeling cosmic futility—will not be helped by being told that meaningful life involves subjective attraction plus objective attractiveness, or orienting toward the good, true, and beautiful. These frameworks describe meaning but do not show how to create or sustain it from within the crisis.

The phenomenological richness of Camus and Sartre—their attention to lived experience of meaninglessness—is precisely what analytic approaches lack. They provide theories *about* meaning rather than frameworks *for* living with meaninglessness.

## 3.4 Pragmatist Dissolution

Richard Rorty and other pragmatists argue that the problem of meaning is pseudo-problem generated by bad philosophy. If we stop asking for cosmic foundations, the crisis dissolves. We can have solidarity, hope, and progress without metaphysical justification (*Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity*).

This is closest to the position I will develop. But straight pragmatism is insufficient:

### 3.4.1 The Dismissal Problem

Rorty's dissolution strategy dismisses rather than addresses existential experience. Telling someone experiencing genuine meaninglessness that their crisis is conceptual confusion shows remarkable insensitivity. The suffering is real even if its philosophical articulation is confused.

### 3.4.2 The Ground-Floor Problem

Pragmatism provides no resources for someone not already embedded in communities of practice. If I am alienated, anomic, unable to find projects that engage me, pragmatism offers no guidance. It describes how values function within practices but not how to construct practices when foundationless.

### 3.4.3 The Normative Gap

Rorty's cheerful anti-foundationalism works when things are going well. But how do we criticize oppressive practices if all values are practice-relative? Rorty's answer—appeal to our liberal democratic practices—is parochial. It provides no standpoint for cross-cultural moral criticism or for critiquing one's own culture.

### 3.4.4 What Pragmatism Gets Right

Despite these problems, pragmatism contains crucial insight: the demand for philosophical foundations is confused. Values do not need cosmic grounding to be genuinely normative. We can construct coherent framework without transcendent justification.

This insight is essential for what I develop in Part II. But pragmatism alone is insufficient. We need to integrate pragmatist epistemology with existential phenomenology and constructivist ethics.

## 3.5 The Synthesis Space

Each alternative contains partial truth:

- **Religious frameworks**: Values need grounding beyond arbitrary preference
- **Sartrean existentialism**: We are radically responsible for our choices and commitments
- **Analytic approaches**: Meaning requires both subjective engagement and objective standards
- **Pragmatism**: Foundationalism is confused; values function without transcendent grounding

But each also fails:

- **Religious frameworks**: Cannot be recovered after critique, require intellectual dishonesty
- **Sartrean existentialism**: Metaphysically extravagant, psychologically implausible, reproduces bootstrapping problem
- **Analytic approaches**: Theoretically sophisticated but existentially inert
- **Pragmatism**: Dismisses rather than addresses lived experience of meaninglessness

The task is to integrate what each gets right while avoiding what each gets wrong. This requires:

1. **From Camus**: Phenomenological attention to lived experience of meaninglessness
2. **From Sartre**: Recognition of radical responsibility (without metaphysical baggage)
3. **From Korsgaard** (not yet discussed): Account of how values emerge from structure of agency itself
4. **From pragmatism**: Anti-foundationalist epistemology and practice-based ethics
5. **From constructivism**: Recognition that values are socially constituted, not individually created
6. **From naturalism**: Metaphysical modesty compatible with scientific worldview

This is the synthesis I call pragmatic existentialism. Part II develops it systematically, showing how it resolves the problems cataloged in Chapters 1-3 while preserving insights from multiple traditions.

## 3.6 The Methodological Point

This chapter has not been mere literature review. It establishes what constraints an adequate philosophy must satisfy:

**Phenomenological adequacy**: Must address lived experience of meaninglessness, not dismiss it as confusion

**Logical coherence**: Must avoid absurdism's bootstrapping problem and Sartre's self-created obligations

**Practical applicability**: Must provide guidance for living, not merely theoretical description

**Psychological sustainability**: Must be livable for actual humans, not requiring superhuman lucidity or tolerance for anxiety

**Political viability**: Must support committed action, distinguish oppression from resistance

**Metaphysical modesty**: Must avoid Sartre's ontological extravagance, remain compatible with naturalism

**Normative force**: Must explain how values constrain us without either transcendence or arbitrariness

Meeting all these constraints simultaneously is the challenge. The failures of existing alternatives demonstrate the difficulty. But the constraints also clarify what success would require.

Part II shows that success is possible—that we can construct philosophy after absurdism that satisfies these desiderata by synthesizing insights existing frameworks develop in isolation. The key is recognizing that values emerge from the structure of rational agency itself, are constituted socially through practices, are tested pragmatically by consequences, and can bind without being cosmically grounded.

But this is not yet argument. It is promissory note. Part II delivers.
