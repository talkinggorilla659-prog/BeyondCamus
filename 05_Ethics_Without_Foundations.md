# Chapter 5: Ethics Without Foundations: The Self-Constitution Solution

The ethical bootstrapping problem is this: How can we have binding values without cosmic grounding? Camus and Sartre both fail to answer. They deny transcendent values while prescribing specific normative commitments. The prescription lacks justification.

This chapter solves the problem by showing that values emerge from the structure of rational agency itself. When I act, I constitute myself as a particular kind of agent. Only certain self-constitutions are coherent and sustainable. Ethics emerges from the practical requirements of coherent agency, tested through consequences rather than derived from cosmic foundations.

This solution draws primarily on Christine Korsgaard's self-constitution framework (*Self-Constitution: Agency, Identity, and Integrity*) integrated with pragmatist epistemology and naturalist metaphysics. The synthesis resolves absurdism's contradictions while avoiding Sartre's metaphysical extravagance and Wolf's problematic objectivism.

## 5.1 The Structure of Agency

To understand how ethics emerges from agency itself, we must first analyze what agency requires.

### 5.1.1 The Standpoint of Deliberation

As Korsgaard argues, agency begins with the standpoint of deliberation. When I deliberate about what to do, I confront the question: What reasons do I have for action?

This is not optional. Rational agents cannot act without taking some considerations as reasons. Even the most impulsive action, if performed by rational agent, involves implicit endorsement: I take this impulse as reason for action.

The structure of deliberation thus involves:
1. Confronting choice
2. Surveying considerations
3. Taking some considerations as reasons
4. Acting on those reasons

This structure is constitutive of rational agency. Non-rational beings (animals, infants, machines) do not deliberate. They respond to stimuli, follow programming, act on impulse. Rational agents reflectively endorse reasons before acting.

### 5.1.2 The Regress Problem

But this raises a question: What makes some consideration a reason? If I take X as reason for action, what justifies treating X as reason?

One might answer: X is reason because of Y. But then what makes Y a reason? This threatens infinite regress. Eventually I must reach considerations I treat as reasons without further justification.

Foundationalists solve this by positing self-justifying basic reasons (God's commands, natural law, categorical imperative, utility). But these foundations are philosophically contentious and, after the collapse of transcendent frameworks, unavailable to many.

Coherentists avoid regress by requiring only that reasons cohere with each other in a reflective equilibrium. But this seems too weak—a coherent system of evil beliefs (the Nazi's worldview) satisfies coherentism without being justified.

Korsgaard's solution is different. Reasons are grounded not in external foundations but in the structure of agency itself. To be a rational agent at all requires treating certain things as reasons. The normativity is internal to agency, not derived from independent metaphysical facts.

### 5.1.3 The Practical Identity

Korsgaard introduces the concept of **practical identity**: "a description under which you find your life to be worth living and your actions to be worth undertaking" (*Self-Constitution*, 19).

Examples:
- I am a parent (this identity gives me reasons: my child's wellbeing matters)
- I am a scientist (this identity gives me reasons: truth-seeking matters)
- I am a citizen (this identity gives me reasons: justice matters)

These identities are not mere descriptions. They are normative commitments that generate reasons for action. When I am parent, my child's suffering is not mere fact but something that *demands* response. The identity constitutes me as agent for whom certain considerations count as reasons.

Crucially, practical identities are *chosen* (though often implicitly, through action rather than explicit decision). I adopt identity of parent through choosing to have children and committing to their care. The identity is not given by biology (merely reproducing does not make one parent in the normative sense) but constituted through commitment.

### 5.1.4 The Coherence Requirement

Here is Korsgaard's key move: Not all practical identities are coherent or sustainable. Some identities undermine the possibility of agency itself.

Consider the identity "I am a liar." If I constitute myself as liar, I undermine the possibility of communication—for why should anyone believe me? If I say "I will do X," you know I'm lying, so my utterance cannot function as promise. The identity defeats itself.

Or consider "I am purely selfish being who recognizes no obligations." This identity undermines the possibility of practical reasoning. If I recognize no obligations, I cannot take anything as genuinely normative reason—only as desire or preference. But practical reasoning requires treating some considerations as *reasons* (having normative force), not mere desires.

The point generalizes: Some practical identities are self-undermining. They cannot be coherently maintained because they undermine the conditions of agency itself.

### 5.1.5 The Self-Constitution Thesis

This generates Korsgaard's central thesis: **Acting constitutes the agent, and only some self-constitutions are possible.**

When I act on reasons emerging from practical identity, I constitute myself as agent of that kind. The actions are not external to identity; they *make* me what I am. As Aristotle said, "We become just by performing just acts" (*Nicomachean Ethics*, 1103a-b).

But I cannot constitute myself as just anything. Some self-constitutions are incoherent (the liar), some are unsustainable (the purely selfish being), some undermine agency itself.

Ethics emerges from the requirements of coherent self-constitution. I am not bound by cosmic law but by the practical requirements of maintaining coherent agency over time.

## 5.2 The Emergence of Normativity

How does this solve the bootstrapping problem? By showing that normativity emerges from the structure of agency itself, not from external foundations.

### 5.2.1 The Source of Obligation

When I constitute myself as parent, I bind myself to parental reasons. My child's wellbeing becomes genuinely normative for me—it *ought* to move me to action, not merely as preference but as obligation.

The obligation is not cosmically grounded. There is no transcendent fact making parenthood obligatory. But neither is it arbitrary. It is binding because:

1. I chose the practical identity (implicitly or explicitly)
2. The identity constitutes who I am as agent
3. The reasons flow from the identity's internal logic
4. Abandoning the identity would require becoming different agent

This is real obligation, not mere preference. I cannot simply decide parental obligations don't bind me without ceasing to be parent—which requires fundamental transformation of identity, not casual choice.

### 5.2.2 The Nazi Objection

Objection: Doesn't this allow the Nazi to constitute themselves as "Aryan warrior" and thereby generate "obligations" to persecute Jews?

No, for several reasons:

**First**, Korsgaard's coherence requirement rules out certain practical identities. The Nazi identity depends on false beliefs about racial hierarchy, denies the humanity of others, and cannot be sustained through rational reflection once these falsities are exposed.

**Second**, practical identities are constrained by recognition of others as agents. To be agent at all requires capacity to recognize other beings as having their own standpoint, reasons, and practical identities. The Nazi identity involves refusing this recognition—treating others as mere objects to be manipulated. This is incoherent with the structure of agency itself.

**Third** (and I add this to Korsgaard), practical identities are tested by consequences. The Nazi identity produces suffering, social breakdown, and ultimately the destruction of the Nazi themselves (as history demonstrates). Pragmatically, it fails. We have consequentialist reasons to reject it.

**But these responses are insufficient.** A sophisticated Nazi could accept that racial science is false yet maintain their identity through cultural rather than biological grounds. They could acknowledge suffering but claim it's justified for the greater good of their Volk. They could point to the Third Reich's temporary successes as evidence of pragmatic viability.

The deeper problem requires sustained argument: Why must recognition be EQUAL recognition, not just any recognition? This is the critical move, and it requires more than Korsgaard provides.

### 5.2.2a The Equal Recognition Requirement: A Sustained Argument

The Nazi says: "I recognize Jews as agents—agents whose interests conflict with my people's flourishing. I don't deny their agency; I simply prioritize Aryan agency over Jewish agency. This is internally coherent and reflects my practical identity as defender of my Volk."

Why is this insufficient? Not because it's incoherent (it may be internally consistent) but because it fails upon reflection when we ask: *What grounds the asymmetry?*

#### The Argument from Practical Reason

When I deliberate about what to do, I give myself reasons. These reasons have normative force for me—they're not mere desires but considerations I ought to weigh.

Now ask: What makes something a reason? What distinguishes genuine reasons from mere impulses or preferences?

**The structure of a reason**: X is a reason if it's a consideration that anyone in similar circumstances should give weight to. Reasons have generality built into them. When I say "The fact that this action would harm my child is a reason not to do it," I'm implicitly committed to: "The fact that action would harm someone's child is a reason for that person not to do it."

This is not Kantian universalizability (requiring I will my maxim as universal law). It's weaker: reasons have an *in principle* shareability structure. If something counts as a reason for me, it must be the kind of consideration that could count as a reason for others in relevantly similar circumstances.

Now apply this to the Nazi case. The Nazi claims: "Aryan flourishing is a reason; Jewish flourishing is not." What grounds this asymmetry?

**Possible answers**:

1. **"Aryans are more valuable"**: This requires objective value hierarchy independent of anyone's practical reasoning. But the Nazi cannot appeal to transcendent values (we've rejected those). And natural facts don't establish value hierarchies (racial science is false; even if genetic differences existed, they wouldn't generate moral hierarchies).

2. **"They're reasons because they're OUR people"**: But this makes normativity relative to group membership. If "being one of us" is what makes interests count, then Jews' interests count for Jews, Aryans' for Aryans. This collapses into relativism that undercuts the Nazi's claim to moral authority to impose on others.

3. **"We simply prefer our flourishing"**: This reduces reasons to preferences. But then the Nazi has no claim that Jews *ought* to subordinate their interests. They can only say "We prefer to dominate you," which Jews can meet with "We prefer to resist." This is might-makes-right, not normative justification.

4. **"Our capacity for high culture makes us more valuable"**: This is perfectionist argument (beings with certain capacities merit greater consideration). But:
   - It's empirically questionable (Jews have produced extraordinary culture)
   - It's dangerous (would imply smart people can dominate less intelligent)
   - It undermines the Nazi's own egalitarianism within the Volk (even low-functioning Aryans count equally)
   - Most importantly: capacity for culture is itself grounded in agency—the ability to deliberate, create, reason. If we value this, we must value it in all who possess it.

**The conclusion**: Once you grant that *anyone's* interests count as reasons (that practical reasoning has normative force), you cannot coherently restrict whose interests count without either:
- Appealing to transcendent values (unavailable)
- Reducing to might-makes-right (abandoning normativity)
- Embracing relativism (undercutting your authority)
- Adopting perfectionism (undermining your own commitments)

The best explanation of why anyone's interests count is: *they are a rational agent capable of practical reasoning*. But this criterion applies equally to all beings with this capacity. You cannot coherently grant normative force to practical reasoning while denying it to some practical reasoners.

#### The Argument from Deliberative Standpoint

When I deliberate, I adopt a standpoint from which I consider reasons. This standpoint is not idiosyncratically mine—it's the standpoint of rational agency as such.

T.M. Scanlon's insight: "Thinking of an action as wrong is thinking that it would be disallowed by principles that no one could reasonably reject" (*What We Owe to Each Other*, 153-154). This builds recognition into the structure of moral thought itself.

When the Nazi deliberates about persecuting Jews, they must ask: "Is this action justified?" Not "Does it serve my preferences?" but "Is it right?"

To ask whether something is right is to ask whether it's justifiable—whether you could defend it to those affected. And to ask this seriously requires treating those affected as potential interlocutors, as agents whose reasons matter.

The Nazi might say: "I can defend it—Jews threaten Aryan existence." But this is empirically false (Jews posed no threat to Germany). Even if it were true, the question would be: "Why does Aryan existence take priority?" And we're back to the previous argument.

**The key insight**: Genuine deliberation about what's right already involves recognizing others as agents whose reasons count. You can refuse genuine deliberation and simply impose your will—but then you've abandoned practical reasoning for force. You're not offering justification; you're wielding power.

This is permissible in the sense that it's possible. But it represents failure of rational agency. It's choosing to be something less than a fully rational agent—someone who reasons practically only within your in-group and treats outsiders as mere obstacles.

#### The Pragmatic Argument

Even if the Nazi finds the above arguments unpersuasive, pragmatic considerations doom their project.

**Sustainability**: Systems that deny equal recognition to category of persons are unstable. They require constant enforcement, produce resistance, generate internal contradictions (as Nazi Germany discovered), and ultimately fail catastrophically.

**Empirical evidence**: Hierarchical systems based on denied recognition—slavery, apartheid, caste oppression—have either collapsed or are collapsing under internal and external pressure. The historical trend is toward greater inclusion, not because of moral progress in abstract sense but because more inclusive systems *work better*.

**The mechanism**: Systems that deny recognition to some:
- Waste human potential (losing contributions of excluded)
- Generate justified resistance (because excluded people are agents who will fight for recognition)
- Require repression that corrupts the dominant group
- Cannot achieve stable equilibrium (always require more violence to maintain)

The Nazi identity is not just morally problematic—it's practically unviable. No society has sustained itself longterm through systematic denial of others' equal agency. This is not accident but reflects structural reality: beings with capacity for practical reason will eventually demand recognition, and denying it requires unsustainable levels of violence.

### 5.2.2b Why Hierarchical Recognition Fails

Some might object: "But hierarchical societies have existed for millennia. Confucian cultures recognize different agency for different roles. Isn't equal recognition just Western liberal ideology?"

This objection requires careful response. I distinguish three forms of hierarchy:

**1. Role-based differentiation**: Different people have different responsibilities based on context. Parents have authority over children (who lack full practical rationality). Teachers have authority in classrooms. Experts have epistemic authority.

**This is compatible with equal recognition.** Children will develop into full agents and deserve recognition of their developing agency. Teachers' authority is limited to specific domain and justified by fostering students' agency. Experts can be challenged and must justify their claims.

**2. Differentiated but reciprocal recognition**: Confucian ethics involves complex web of mutual obligations. The elder has authority but also obligations to the younger. The ruler has power but also duties to the people.

**This is also compatible with equal recognition** (broadly construed). Even if roles differ, each person's agency is recognized within their role. The problem arises only when roles cannot be questioned or revised, when some are permanently subordinated.

**3. Categorical denial of equal moral status**: Some categories of persons are inherently inferior, may be treated as mere means, have no claim to recognition.

**This is what fails.** Slavery, racial hierarchy, gender subordination that denies women's full agency—these cannot be sustained through rational reflection because they arbitrarily restrict who counts morally.

The sophisticated hierarchist might say: "But we have reasons for the hierarchy—women are naturally suited for domestic roles, lower castes lack spiritual development, etc."

These claims are either:
- **Empirically false** (women and lower castes demonstrate full rational capacities when given opportunity)
- **Circular** (spiritual development is denied then cited as justification for denial)
- **Self-undermining** (if rational capacity varies, this should determine individual treatment, not category membership—smart women should be treated as fully agential, less capable men should be subordinated, which no hierarchical system does)

**The core problem**: Hierarchical systems that deny equal recognition to categories of persons cannot coherently justify the denial upon reflection. They must appeal to tradition, divine command, or brute force—but cannot provide reasons that those subjected to hierarchy should accept.

And once we acknowledge that people are rational agents capable of evaluating reasons, we cannot consistently deny them standing to evaluate the reasons offered for their subordination.

### 5.2.3 The Recognition Requirement (Revised)

Korsgaard argues that agency itself requires recognizing others as agents. When I deliberate, I implicitly treat my reasons as potentially shareable—I could explain and defend them to others. This presupposes others are rational beings capable of evaluating reasons.

Moreover, many practical identities are essentially social (parent, teacher, friend, citizen). These identities require recognizing others as agents with their own standpoint. I cannot be parent without recognizing my child as developing agent whose autonomy I must respect. I cannot be friend without recognizing my friend as equal agent whose good matters.

This generates what Korsgaard calls **obligation to humanity**—not as cosmic moral fact but as structural requirement of social agency. To be agent embedded in relationships requires recognizing others' agency.

This is not Kantian categorical imperative (though it resembles it). I am not claiming to derive universal moral law from reason alone. I am claiming that agency embedded in social world requires recognition of others—and this recognition constrains what practical identities are coherent.

### 5.2.4 The Practical Constraint

I add to Korsgaard's framework a pragmatist element: practical identities are tested by their consequences for agency and human flourishing.

A practical identity is problematic if it:
- Undermines the agent's own capacity for agency (addiction, self-destruction)
- Undermines others' agency (domination, violence, deception)
- Cannot be sustained through changing circumstances (too rigid)
- Produces systematic suffering without compensating goods
- Requires false beliefs to maintain
- Cannot survive rational reflection

These are empirical tests, not a priori principles. We discover through experience which identities are sustainable, which undermine agency, which produce flourishing or suffering.

This pragmatist addition addresses a weakness in Korsgaard: her framework is sometimes too formal, too divorced from consequences. By adding pragmatist tests, we ensure practical identities are constrained not only by coherence but by livability.

## 5.3 Resolving the Bootstrapping Problem

Return now to Camus's ethical bootstrapping problem: How can we derive normative conclusions from purely descriptive premises about meaninglessness?

The self-constitution framework shows the question is misconceived. We do not derive ethics from metaphysical premises. We ground ethics in the structure of rational agency itself.

### 5.3.1 The Solution

**Premise 1**: I am a rational agent (I deliberate and act on reasons)

**Premise 2**: To act, I must constitute myself as having particular practical identity

**Premise 3**: Only certain practical identities are coherent and sustainable

**Premise 4**: Coherent practical identities involve recognition of others' agency and constraints on action

**Conclusion**: Therefore, I have obligations—not cosmically grounded, but grounded in requirements of coherent agency

This argument does not derive "ought" from "is." It shows that oughts are internal to the practice of rational agency. If I am agent at all, I am already subject to normative constraints.

### 5.3.2 Why This Avoids Arbitrariness

The obligations are not arbitrary because they are constrained by:
- The structure of rational agency (coherence requirements)
- Social nature of selfhood (recognition of others)
- Empirical facts about human flourishing (pragmatic tests)
- Deliberative process of reflective equilibrium

Different agents in different situations will develop different practical identities—but not arbitrarily. The identities emerge from situated deliberation about how to live given one's talents, relationships, values, and circumstances.

### 5.3.3 Why This Avoids Transcendence

The obligations do not require cosmic grounding because they are not claims about universe's values. They are claims about requirements of coherent agency.

When I say "I ought to care for my child," I am not asserting transcendent moral fact. I am expressing commitment constitutive of my identity as parent—commitment that binds me because abandoning it would require becoming different agent, which is possible but not trivial.

The normativity is real but not transcendent. It is binding but not cosmically validated. This is what ethics after absurdism looks like.

## 5.4 Practical Identities and Meaning

The self-constitution framework also addresses the meaning question. Meaningful life involves coherent practical identities that engage one's capacities and connect one to others.

### 5.4.1 The Fitting Fulfillment Reconceived

Recall Susan Wolf's view: meaning requires subjective fulfillment *plus* objective attractiveness. The problem was grounding "objective attractiveness" without transcendence.

Self-constitution framework provides the grounding. A project is "objectively attractive" (or better: "worth pursuing") if:
- It emerges from coherent practical identity
- It develops genuine capacities
- It connects agent to others in recognizing ways
- It survives reflective scrutiny
- It contributes to rather than undermines human flourishing (pragmatic test)

These criteria are not cosmically validated but they are not arbitrary. They constrain which projects can constitute meaningful life.

### 5.4.2 The Sadist Revisited

Wolf's paradigm case of meaningless life was the sadist who finds torture fulfilling. Why does this lack meaning?

Self-constitution answer: The sadist identity is incoherent. It requires refusing to recognize victims' agency (treating them as mere objects for one's pleasure). But agency requires capacity for recognition of others. The sadist must simultaneously possess agency (to deliberate about torture) and deny it (refuse recognition of victims). This is self-undermining.

Moreover, the sadist identity cannot survive reflective scrutiny. Once the sadist genuinely imagines being in the victim's position—exercises the capacity for perspective-taking that agency requires—the identity collapses. It can only be maintained through willful refusal of reflection.

Finally, pragmatically the sadist identity produces suffering without compensating goods and requires social structures (secrecy, power imbalance) that undermine trust and cooperation.

### 5.4.3 Meaning Without Cosmic Purpose

I can live meaningful life through:
- Developing practical identities that engage my capacities (parent, teacher, artist, activist)
- Pursuing projects emerging from these identities
- Connecting with others through recognition of shared agency
- Contributing to human flourishing
- Maintaining coherence through reflective equilibrium

None of this requires cosmic purpose. The meaning is real—these projects and relationships genuinely matter, generate reasons for action, constitute who I am. But it is human meaning, grounded in human agency, not cosmic significance.

This is meaning after absurdism: meaning that survives the collapse of transcendent frameworks by being grounded in practical rationality rather than metaphysical foundations.

## 5.5 The Pragmatist Addition

Korsgaard's framework is powerful but incomplete. It is too formalist—focused on coherence and rational structure while insufficiently attentive to consequences and empirical constraints. I supplement it with pragmatist epistemology.

### 5.5.1 Values Are Tested, Not Derived

Pragmatism's central insight: we do not derive values from first principles; we test them through experience and revise based on consequences.

A practical identity is not validated by deduction from metaphysical premises. It is tested by:
- Does it enable flourishing over time?
- Does it sustain agency through challenges?
- Does it produce suffering for agent or others?
- Can it survive reflective scrutiny and social criticism?
- Does it adapt to changing circumstances?

These are empirical questions requiring ongoing inquiry, not a priori truths derived once and for all.

### 5.5.2 Fallibilism

Pragmatism is fallibilist: our value commitments are always revisable in light of experience. I might discover that practical identity I adopted is unsustainable, produces suffering, or rests on false beliefs. I must then revise.

This fallibilism applies even to seemingly fundamental commitments. I might discover that my conception of parenthood is too controlling, my professional identity too consuming, my political commitments too rigid. Growth involves revising practical identities in light of experience.

This may seem to undermine normativity—if all values are revisable, are any binding? But revisability does not imply arbitrariness. Values bind *now* while remaining open to revision *later* through deliberation. This is how rational belief works in all domains.

### 5.5.3 The Community of Inquiry

Values are tested not only individually but socially. I discover which practical identities are sustainable partly through observing others, learning from tradition, engaging in moral conversation.

This is not relativism—not "values are whatever my community says." It is social epistemology: we learn about values through collective inquiry, much as we learn about natural world through collective scientific investigation.

Just as individual scientist can be wrong while scientific community converges on truth over time, individual agent can be confused about values while community of inquiry progresses morally. This explains moral progress without requiring transcendent standards.

### 5.5.4 Integration With Self-Constitution

The pragmatist addition strengthens Korsgaard's framework:

**Korsgaard provides**: The structure showing how normativity emerges from agency itself

**Pragmatism provides**: The methodology for testing which practical identities are sustainable

Together they show: Ethics emerges from requirements of coherent agency (Korsgaard) and is refined through experience and collective inquiry (pragmatism). This combination grounds values without either transcendence or arbitrariness.

## 5.6 Remaining Objections

### 5.6.1 "This Still Requires A Choice"

Objection: Even if coherent agency requires certain practical identities, I must still *choose* to be coherent agent. Why not embrace incoherence?

Response: This objection is incoherent. To deliberate about whether to be agent is already to be agent. I cannot step outside agency to evaluate it from neutral standpoint. The demand for justification of agency itself is confused.

As Korsgaard argues, agency is not hypothesis requiring justification but standpoint from which justification proceeds. The question "Why be rational?" cannot be answered because asking it presupposes rationality.

### 5.6.2 "You're Smuggling In Kantianism"

Objection: This framework is just Kantian ethics disguised. You're deriving morality from practical reason, which is what Kant did.

Response: There are important differences:

- **Kant**: Derived universal moral law from pure practical reason alone
- **This framework**: Shows obligations emerge from practical identities, which vary by agent and situation

- **Kant**: Categorical imperative is a priori truth binding all rational beings
- **This framework**: Obligations emerge from situated agency and are tested empirically

- **Kant**: Noumenal self transcends empirical nature
- **This framework**: Naturalist—agency is biological and social phenomenon

The resemblance is real (both ground ethics in practical reason rather than metaphysics), but the differences are substantial.

### 5.6.3 "Some Practical Identities Still Seem Problematic"

Objection: What about the identity "I am warrior" or "I am devoted to nation above all"? These seem coherent and sustainable but potentially dangerous.

Response: These identities are not automatically problematic. Warrior identity can be coherent if constrained by recognition of others' humanity (just war theory). National devotion can be coherent if balanced with cosmopolitan recognition.

The identities become problematic when they require denying others' agency (warrior who sees enemies as subhuman) or produce systematic suffering without compensating goods (nationalism that leads to genocide).

These are empirical questions. We test practical identities by their consequences. Some identities we might initially think coherent turn out to undermine agency or produce suffering. We learn through experience.

### 5.6.4 "This Doesn't Help Someone In Crisis"

Objection: Someone experiencing existential crisis—unable to find meaning, paralyzed by absurdity—will not be helped by abstract philosophy about self-constitution.

Response: Partially true. Someone in acute crisis may need therapeutic intervention, not philosophy. But for those capable of philosophical engagement, this framework provides guidance:

1. Identify your practical identities (even minimal ones: "I am person who values honesty")
2. Ask which identities are sustainable and coherent
3. Consider which identities engage your capacities
4. Recognize that commitments emerging from practical identities can bind without cosmic validation
5. Accept that meaning is human meaning—this is sufficient

This is more helpful than Camus's prescription (maintain tension without resolution) or Sartre's (choose authentically from total possibility). It provides structure for deliberation while avoiding both transcendence and arbitrariness.

## 5.7 Transition to Social Constitution

This chapter has shown how ethics emerges from the structure of individual agency. But this is incomplete. Agency is always already social—constituted through relationships, embedded in practices, responsive to others.

Chapter 6 develops the social dimension, showing that practical identities are not individually created but socially constituted. This moves beyond both Camus's individualism and Sartre's conflictual account of social relations. It also provides foundation for political philosophy that absurdism lacked.

The key insight: meaning is never purely individual. We become agents through relationships, develop practical identities within communities, test values through social inquiry. The self-constitution framework must be socialized.

But the preliminary work is complete. We have shown that:
- Normativity emerges from requirements of coherent agency (not cosmic foundations)
- Practical identities generate binding obligations (without transcendence)
- Values are tested pragmatically (not derived a priori)
- Meaning is possible without cosmic purpose (as coherent engagement of capacities)

This solves the ethical bootstrapping problem. Ethics without foundations is possible because ethics is not founded on metaphysics but on the structure of practical rationality itself. Now we must show how that structure is inherently social.
