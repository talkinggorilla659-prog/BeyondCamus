# Chapter 5: Ethics Without Foundations: The Self-Constitution Solution

The ethical bootstrapping problem is this: How can we have binding values without cosmic grounding? Camus and Sartre both fail to answer. They deny transcendent values while prescribing specific normative commitments. The prescription lacks justification.

This chapter solves the problem by showing that values emerge from the structure of rational agency itself. When I act, I constitute myself as a particular kind of agent. Only certain self-constitutions are coherent and sustainable. Ethics emerges from the practical requirements of coherent agency, tested through consequences rather than derived from cosmic foundations.

This solution draws primarily on Christine Korsgaard's self-constitution framework (*Self-Constitution: Agency, Identity, and Integrity*) integrated with pragmatist epistemology and naturalist metaphysics. The synthesis resolves absurdism's contradictions while avoiding Sartre's metaphysical extravagance and Wolf's problematic objectivism.

## 5.1 From Phenomenology to Structure

The preceding chapters diagnosed the absurdist predicament and showed why Camus's attempted solution fails. But I claimed that the diagnosis remains valid even if the prescription requires replacement. This raises a question: If we abandon Camus's framework, do we lose his phenomenological insights?

No. This chapter shows that what Camus described phenomenologically, self-constitution theory describes analytically. These are not competing frameworks but complementary descriptions of the same phenomenon—one existential, one structural. Camus identified the experience of meaning-seeking under conditions of metaphysical silence. Korsgaard explicates the mechanism by which meaning-seeking operates: through self-constitution. The phenomenology and the structure converge.

This is not rescue operation. I am not "fixing" Camus by adding Korsgaard. I am arguing that Absurdism, properly understood, *implies* Constitutivism. When we analyze what it means to be a "meaning-seeking creature confronting an indifferent universe," we discover we are describing self-constituting agency under Absurdist constraints. The bootstrapping problem arises only when we fail to recognize this implication.

### 5.1.1 Two Descriptions of One Reality

Consider what Camus tells us about the human condition:

**First**, humans are meaning-seeking beings. We cannot help but ask "Why?" We demand unity, coherence, justification. This is not psychological peculiarity but structural feature of human consciousness. Ceasing to seek meaning would require ceasing to be recognizably human.

**Second**, this meaning-seeking happens against metaphysical silence. The universe offers no answers. Our demand for unity meets pluralism and contingency. Our desire for justification meets indifference. The silence is not temporary ignorance but permanent condition.

**Third**, we cannot escape this confrontation. We cannot stop seeking meaning, cannot make the universe speak, cannot genuinely commit suicide (which would merely flee the problem). We are condemned to live in the tension.

This is Camus's phenomenological diagnosis, and it remains phenomenologically accurate. But notice what it describes: a being who *must* act despite the absence of given meaning. A being who cannot not-choose. A being whose very existence requires taking some considerations as reasons for action even though the universe provides no reasons.

Now consider what Korsgaard tells us about agency:

**First**, to be a rational agent is to deliberate—to confront the question "What should I do?" and act on reasons. This is not optional for rational beings. Even the most spontaneous action by a rational agent involves implicit endorsement of reasons.

**Second**, acting on reasons requires practical identity—a conception of oneself that generates reasons. I act as parent, as artist, as citizen. These identities are not given by nature but constituted through action. They are normative self-conceptions that make certain considerations count as reasons.

**Third**, we cannot escape self-constitution. To act at all is to constitute oneself as agent of some kind. Even the attempt to avoid commitment is itself a form of self-constitution (as drifter, as one who refuses binding identities). There is no exit from the structure of agency.

**The convergence**: These are two descriptions of the same phenomenon.

When Camus says humans are "meaning-seeking beings," he is describing what Korsgaard calls "self-constituting agents." To seek meaning is not some activity separate from action—it *is* action, understood as the constitution of practical identity. When I ask "What makes life meaningful?" I am asking "What practical identities should I adopt? What reasons should I act from?"

When Camus says the universe offers no meaning, he is describing what we might call the "metaphysical background" against which agency operates. Korsgaard's framework typically assumes agency happens in philosophically neutral space. But Camus insists: no, agency happens against silence. The universe provides no validation for the identities we constitute. We are self-constituting agents in an indifferent cosmos.

When Camus says we cannot escape the confrontation, he is describing what Korsgaard calls the "inescapability of the standpoint of agency." We cannot step outside practical reasoning to evaluate it neutrally. We are always already agents, always already constituting ourselves through action, always already taking some considerations as reasons.

The phenomenology and the structure are not competing. They are complementary. Camus describes what it *feels like* to be self-constituting agent under Absurdist conditions. Korsgaard describes *how the mechanism works*. Neither cancels the other. Together they provide complete picture: existence precedes essence (existential insight), and existence operates through self-constitution (structural insight).

### 5.1.1a The Logical Chain: From Phenomenology to Structure

The convergence described above is not merely suggestive parallel but logical entailment. To demonstrate this rigorously, I provide a step-by-step derivation showing that what Camus describes phenomenologically *is* what Korsgaard describes structurally when we make the implications explicit.

**Step 1: Camus's Phenomenological Starting Point**

Camus observes that humans are meaning-seeking beings who confront a meaningless universe. What does "meaning-seeking" mean? It cannot mean merely desiring that meaning exist (one might desire flying without being a "flight-seeking being"). Rather, it means that we *cannot help but* seek meaning—it is a constitutive feature of human consciousness. As Camus writes: "At any streetcorner the feeling of absurdity can strike any man in the face" (*Myth*, 13). We continuously interrogate our experience for significance.

More precisely: we are beings who ask "Why?" of our circumstances, who demand coherence, who seek justification for our actions. This is not optional. Even the decision to stop asking is itself an answer to "Why should I continue?" The interrogative stance is inescapable.

**Step 2: What "Meaning-Seeking" Requires Structurally**

What must be true of a being that cannot help but seek meaning? Such a being must be capable of:
- Evaluating potential actions (otherwise "meaning" has no practical import)
- Distinguishing better from worse options (otherwise all options are equally meaningful/meaningless)
- Acting on the basis of these evaluations (otherwise meaning-seeking is idle speculation)

In philosophical terminology: a meaning-seeking being must be a *deliberative agent*—one who acts for reasons. The "Why?" that Camus identifies is precisely the question of reasons: "Why do this rather than that? What justifies this action?"

Therefore: To be meaning-seeking in Camus's sense entails being a deliberative agent in the philosophical sense.

**Step 3: What Acting From Reasons Requires**

But we cannot act "from reasons" in the abstract. The consideration "this would reduce suffering" only counts as a reason for action if I take suffering-reduction as mattering. The consideration "this would advance scientific knowledge" only counts as a reason if I take truth-seeking as valuable.

What makes certain considerations count as reasons for me? This requires what Korsgaard calls a "practical identity"—a normative self-conception that generates reasons. I act as parent (child's wellbeing matters), as scientist (truth matters), as citizen (justice matters). These identities determine my practical reasoning.

Therefore: To deliberate from reasons requires adopting practical identities that make certain considerations count as reasons.

**Step 4: Practical Identities Under Absurdist Constraints**

Here Camus's insight becomes crucial. These practical identities are not given by the universe. When I constitute myself as parent, the universe does not validate this identity. There is no cosmic endorsement, no transcendent purpose to parenting, no metaphysical fact that makes "parent" the correct practical identity for me.

This means practical identities must be *self-constituted*—created through commitment and sustained through action, not discovered in the fabric of reality. I become a parent (in the normative sense) by committing to my child's care and acting on that commitment. The identity is constituted through the very acts it subsequently justifies.

But this constitution happens against what Camus calls "metaphysical silence." The universe offers no validation. My practical identity is a wager I make without cosmic warranty.

Therefore: Meaning-seeking under Absurdist conditions (Camus) entails self-constitution without transcendent validation (Korsgaard under specific metaphysical constraints).

**Step 5: This IS the Self-Constitution Framework**

Korsgaard's framework analyzes agency as follows:
- Agents deliberate about what to do
- Deliberation requires taking certain considerations as reasons
- Taking considerations as reasons requires practical identities
- Practical identities are constituted through reflective endorsement and action
- These identities are normative self-conceptions that structure our practical reasoning

Notice: This is precisely what we derived from analyzing what Camus means by "meaning-seeking being confronting meaninglessness." The phenomenological description and the structural analysis converge not accidentally but necessarily.

The only addition Camus makes is specifying the metaphysical background: this self-constitution happens without cosmic validation. But this is a specification of context, not a contradiction of mechanism. Korsgaard describes *how* agency works; Camus describes *under what conditions* it works for reflective modern consciousness.

**Step 6: The Entailment Relationship**

We can now state the relationship precisely:

**Camus's claim**: Humans are meaning-seeking beings in a meaningless universe, condemned to live in this tension.

**Logical implications**:
- Meaning-seeking → deliberative agency (Step 2)
- Deliberative agency → acting from reasons (Step 2)
- Acting from reasons → practical identities (Step 3)
- Practical identities without cosmic validation → self-constitution (Step 4)
- Self-constitution as mechanism of agency → Korsgaard's framework (Step 5)

**Conclusion**: Absurdism (properly understood) entails Constitutivism (under Absurdist metaphysical constraints). Camus's phenomenology *implies* Korsgaard's structure. They are not competing frameworks but complementary descriptions—one experiential, one analytical—of the same phenomenon.

This is not synthesis of disparate elements but recognition of what was always implicit. When Camus described the human condition, he was describing self-constituting agency. When Korsgaard analyzes agency, she is analyzing the mechanism of meaning-seeking. The bootstrapping problem arose only because Camus did not recognize that his phenomenology already contained the normative structure he sought.

**The philosophical payoff**: We need not "add" normativity to Absurdism or "justify" values through external framework. Normativity is intrinsic to the meaning-seeking that Camus correctly identified. Values emerge from the structure of agency itself—an agency that operates under Absurdist constraints but is not rendered arbitrary by them.

### 5.1.2 The Mechanism of Meaning-Seeking

To make this convergence more precise, we must examine the mechanism by which meaning-seeking operates.

Camus's error—the source of the bootstrapping problem—was treating "revolt" and "solidarity" as intuitive responses to the Absurd without explaining *how* these responses are generated. He described what we should do (maintain tension, create meaning through action, recognize others) but not *why* these responses follow from the diagnosis or *how* they are possible.

The self-constitution framework provides the missing mechanism.

**How meaning-seeking works**:

When I confront the absence of given meaning, I face the question: "What should I do? What reasons do I have for action?" This is not abstract philosophical question but practical necessity. Life requires action, action requires reasons, and I must determine what counts as reason for me.

I answer by adopting practical identities. "I am a parent"—suddenly my child's wellbeing becomes reason for action. "I am a scientist"—suddenly truth-seeking becomes reason for action. "I am a member of this community"—suddenly others' flourishing becomes reason for action.

These identities are not discovered in nature or revealed by God. They are *constituted* through my actions and commitments. When I choose to have a child and commit to their care, I constitute myself as parent. The identity is not given by mere biology (reproducing does not make one parent in the normative sense) but created through commitment and sustained through action.

**This is what meaning-seeking looks like at the structural level.** To seek meaning is to seek reasons for action. To seek reasons is to ask what practical identities to adopt. To adopt practical identities is to constitute oneself as agent for whom certain considerations matter.

The "demand for meaning" that Camus identified is not mysterious metaphysical hunger. It is the practical necessity of acting from reasons, which requires practical identity, which must be constituted rather than discovered.

**But—and this is crucial—this constitution happens against the Silence.**

Korsgaard's account of agency typically proceeds as if the metaphysical background were neutral or irrelevant. You constitute yourself as parent, and this identity generates reasons—full stop. But Camus insists we cannot ignore the background. The universe does not endorse my parental identity. There is no cosmic validation, no transcendent meaning to being a parent, no guarantee that this identity is "right" or "correct" or "divinely ordained."

This matters enormously. It means self-constitution under Absurdist conditions is always an act of defiance. I constitute myself as parent *despite* the universe's indifference. I generate reasons for action *without* cosmic warranty. I take my child's suffering as reason to act *even though* the universe does not mark suffering as objectively bad.

This is agency *in spite of* the void, not agency comfortably unaware of it.

The metaphysical silence does not make agency impossible—we continue to deliberate and act. But it removes certain supports that traditional ethics assumed. I cannot justify my practical identities by appealing to God's commands, natural teleology, cosmic purpose, or transcendent values. The identities must justify themselves through their internal coherence and practical sustainability, or they justify nothing at all.

**This transforms self-constitution from comfortable philosophical framework into existential struggle.**

Every practical identity I adopt is a wager against silence. Every reason I take as binding is an assertion made without cosmic backing. Every commitment I make is a decision to act *as if* something matters when the universe insists nothing does.

But it is not arbitrary. The universe's silence does not mean all practical identities are equally valid. Some identities are coherent, others collapse under scrutiny. Some sustain agency over time, others undermine it. Some survive confrontation with reality, others require willful delusion. The Absurdist constraints are real constraints.

### 5.1.3 Why This Solves the Bootstrapping Problem

Return to the ethical bootstrapping problem: How can we derive normative conclusions from purely descriptive premises about meaninglessness?

Camus claimed: "The universe is meaningless, therefore we should revolt." This is invalid. From "is meaningless" we cannot derive "should revolt" without smuggling in normative premises.

But once we see that Absurdism implies Constitutivism, the problem dissolves. We are not deriving normativity from metaphysical facts. We are recognizing that normativity is inherent in the structure of agency itself—and that this structure operates even (especially) under Absurdist conditions.

**The revised argument**:

**Premise 1**: I am a meaning-seeking being confronting an indifferent universe (phenomenological fact)

**Premise 2**: To be meaning-seeking in this sense is to be a self-constituting agent—one who must act from reasons without cosmic validation (structural implication)

**Premise 3**: Acting from reasons requires adopting practical identities that generate those reasons (mechanism of agency)

**Premise 4**: Only certain practical identities are coherent and sustainable under Absurdist constraints (constraint on self-constitution)

**Conclusion**: Therefore I have normative constraints—not cosmically grounded, but grounded in the requirements of coherent agency under Absurdist conditions

This is not deriving "ought" from "is." It is recognizing that if I am agent at all (Premise 1-2), I am already subject to normative constraints (Premise 3-4). The normativity is not *derived* from the Absurd but *inherent* in agential structure—a structure that Camus's phenomenology correctly identified even if he failed to analyze its implications.

**Why Camus missed this**:

Camus treated "meaning-seeking" as psychological fact rather than structural feature of agency. He thought we could acknowledge meaninglessness while maintaining "revolt" through sheer will. But meaning-seeking is not emotion to be maintained through effort. It is the structure of rational agency itself—inescapable as long as we deliberate and act.

Once we see this, the bootstrapping problem vanishes. We are not trying to extract values from valueless universe. We are recognizing that values are generated by structure of agency—and that this generation happens whether or not the universe provides meaning. The Absurd does not create values (Camus was right about that). But neither does the Absurd prevent the value-generating mechanism of self-constitution from operating.

**The key insight**: Normativity is not cosmic but agential. It emerges not from the universe's nature but from agency's structure. The universe's silence is therefore irrelevant to whether normativity exists. It is relevant to *which* normative frameworks are tenable (those requiring cosmic grounding fail), but not to whether any are tenable (those grounded in agency succeed).

This is what Camus intuited but could not articulate. His "revolt" and "solidarity" were correct instincts about what coherent agency requires under Absurdist conditions. But without the structural account, they appeared as arbitrary choices—things Camus preferred but could not justify. With the structural account, they appear as consequences of taking agency seriously in a world without transcendent meaning.

### 5.1.4 The Absurdist Constraints

If self-constitution theory provides the mechanism that Camus lacked, Absurdism provides constraints that Korsgaard typically ignores. The synthesis is not one framework swallowing the other but mutual supplementation.

Standard constitutivism asks: "What makes agency coherent? What practical identities can be sustained through rational reflection?" These are the right questions, but they are asked in philosophical vacuum, as if the metaphysical background did not matter.

**Absurdist constitutivism adds**: "What makes agency coherent *under conditions of metaphysical silence*? What practical identities can be sustained when we cannot appeal to God, natural teleology, cosmic purpose, or transcendent validation?"

This adds constraints. Practical identities that were tenable in pre-Absurdist framework become untenable once we acknowledge the silence.

**Constraint 1: No Cosmic Validation**

Traditional practical identities often depended on cosmic backing: "I am monk" derived meaning from serving God's plan. "I am subject of the King" derived authority from divine right. "I am natural being fulfilling my telos" derived normativity from natural law.

Under Absurdist constraints, these identities lose their foundation. This does not mean monasticism is impossible—but the monastic identity must be reconceived. One cannot justify it through serving cosmic purpose (there is none) but only through the identity's internal coherence, its development of human capacities, its sustainability under rational reflection.

This is more demanding, not less. Cosmic backing made practical identities easy—God commands, therefore I obey. Absurdist self-constitution offers no such comfort. Every identity must justify itself without transcendent warrant.

**Constraint 2: Mortality as Horizon**

Camus insisted on mortality as permanent feature of human condition. We cannot appeal to immortal soul or eternal existence to ground meaning. Practical identities must be sustainable within finite lifespan, recognizing death as absolute horizon.

This rules out certain identities: "I am building legacy that will last forever" is self-deception. "I am earning eternal reward" appeals to what we cannot affirm. "My significance transcends my lifetime" mistakes human meaning for cosmic significance.

But it does not make meaning impossible. It makes meaning finite, local, human-scaled. "I am parent contributing to my child's flourishing *within their lifetime and mine*" is coherent. "I am artist creating work that may outlast me *without requiring that it do so*" is sustainable. The identities must accept finitude rather than deny it.

**Constraint 3: Contingency as Condition**

The universe is not designed for human flourishing. Circumstances are arbitrary, suffering is not distributed justly, effort does not guarantee success. Practical identities must be sustainable despite radical contingency—the possibility of arbitrary failure, undeserved suffering, meaningless destruction.

This rules out identities requiring cosmic justice: "I am good person who will be rewarded" appeals to guarantee the universe does not provide. "I am building utopia" assumes history has direction it lacks. These identities cannot survive confrontation with contingency.

But again, this does not make meaning impossible. It makes meaning *tragic*. "I am activist working for justice *knowing I may fail*" is coherent. "I am parent protecting my child *recognizing I cannot ultimately save them from mortality*" is sustainable. The identities must accept contingency rather than deny it.

**Constraint 4: Solidarity Without Transcendence**

Camus intuited that solidarity with others was ethically necessary but could not justify it without smuggling in humanist values he had no ground for. The Absurdist constraint is: practical identities must explain obligations to others without appealing to God-given human dignity, natural law, or cosmic significance of persons.

This is perhaps the most demanding constraint. Much traditional ethics grounded obligations in transcendent features: imago dei, rational nature as end-in-itself, immortal soul. Under Absurdist constraints, these foundations collapse.

But the recognition requirement can be grounded differently—in the structure of agency itself. To be agent embedded in social world requires recognizing others as agents with their own reasons and practical identities. This recognition is not cosmic fact but structural requirement of social agency. (Section 5.2 will develop this extensively.)

**The result**: Absurdist constitutivism is more constrained than standard Korsgaardian constitutivism. It has fewer degrees of freedom, not more. Practical identities that would be coherent in neutral metaphysical background become untenable once we acknowledge the silence, mortality, contingency, and absence of transcendent validation.

But this makes the theory stronger, not weaker. It cannot be dismissed as permitting arbitrary practical identities. The Absurdist constraints bite hard. Many identities people actually adopt (those requiring belief in cosmic justice, eternal significance, guaranteed success, divine validation) fail under these constraints.

The identities that survive are those that can be sustained while fully acknowledging the Absurd—while accepting mortality, embracing contingency, recognizing silence, and generating solidarity without transcendent grounding. These are practical identities for adults who refuse comfortable delusions.

### 5.1.5 What This Means for the Rest of the Book

If the argument so far is correct, we can proceed with confidence that we are not abandoning Camus's insights but formalizing them. The phenomenology of the Absurd remains accurate; we are adding the structural account that makes sense of it.

**The path forward**:

**Section 5.2** (following sections) will develop Korsgaard's self-constitution framework in detail, showing precisely how practical identities generate reasons and why certain identities are incoherent. But now we understand this framework applies *under Absurdist constraints*—which strengthens rather than weakens it.

**Chapter 6** will develop the social dimension, showing that practical identities are not individually created but socially constituted through recognition. Camus's "solidarity" was not arbitrary ethical preference but structural requirement of social agency. We need each other not for cosmic reasons but because agency itself is irreducibly social.

**Chapter 7** will apply this to concrete life: work, love, parenting, suffering, mortality. These domains of meaning are not escapes from the Absurd but sites where we constitute ourselves as agents *despite* the Absurd. The craftsman does not avoid existential questions—he confronts them through his craft.

**Chapter 10** will introduce what I call the "sustainability test"—the criterion for evaluating practical identities. An identity is valid to the degree it can be maintained under full consciousness of Absurdist conditions (mortality, contingency, silence). This test explains why certain identities fail (they require metaphysical delusions) while others succeed (they accept Absurdist constraints and work within them).

**The payoff**: We get ethics without foundations, meaning without cosmic purpose, obligations without transcendence—precisely what Camus sought but could not justify. The justification comes from recognizing that Absurdism and Constitutivism are not competing frameworks but complementary descriptions of the same phenomenon: human agency under conditions of metaphysical silence.

**Against the charge of "Frankenstein philosophy"**: This is not stitching together incompatible parts. It is showing that existential phenomenology (Camus) and analytic agency theory (Korsgaard) converge when we examine them carefully. The phenomenology describes the experience, the structure describes the mechanism. Both are needed for complete account.

**Against the charge of "betraying Camus"**: We are not replacing his insights but completing his project. He drew the blueprints: humans seek meaning, universe offers none, we must create meaning through action without transcendent validation. We are building the engine those blueprints implied: meaning-creation operates through self-constitution, constrained by coherence and tested pragmatically, generating obligations through recognition requirements rather than cosmic foundations.

**The tragic element remains**: Self-constitution under Absurdist constraints is not comfortable. Every practical identity is wager against silence. Every commitment is made without guarantee. Every meaning generated is human meaning only—real and binding but never cosmically validated. We constitute ourselves knowing the universe does not care. This is agency as defiance, ethics as rebellion, meaning as human creation in the face of indifference.

But it is *possible*. And that is what Camus needed to show but could not: that life without transcendent meaning is not merely absurd but livable, that revolt against the Absurd can be rationally coherent, that solidarity with others can be justified without appealing to what we no longer believe.

The rest of this chapter develops the machinery in detail. But the foundation is now clear: We are not abandoning absurdism for some other philosophy. We are showing what absurdism, properly understood, necessarily implies about human agency, ethics, and meaning.

---

## 5.2 The Structure of Agency

To understand how ethics emerges from agency itself, we must first analyze what agency requires.

### 5.2.1 The Standpoint of Deliberation

As Korsgaard argues, agency begins with the standpoint of deliberation. When I deliberate about what to do, I confront the question: What reasons do I have for action?

This is not optional. Rational agents cannot act without taking some considerations as reasons. Even the most impulsive action, if performed by rational agent, involves implicit endorsement: I take this impulse as reason for action.

The structure of deliberation thus involves:
1. Confronting choice
2. Surveying considerations
3. Taking some considerations as reasons
4. Acting on those reasons

This structure is constitutive of rational agency. Non-rational beings (animals, infants, machines) do not deliberate. They respond to stimuli, follow programming, act on impulse. Rational agents reflectively endorse reasons before acting.

### 5.2.2 The Regress Problem

But this raises a question: What makes some consideration a reason? If I take X as reason for action, what justifies treating X as reason?

One might answer: X is reason because of Y. But then what makes Y a reason? This threatens infinite regress. Eventually I must reach considerations I treat as reasons without further justification.

Foundationalists solve this by positing self-justifying basic reasons (God's commands, natural law, categorical imperative, utility). But these foundations are philosophically contentious and, after the collapse of transcendent frameworks, unavailable to many.

Coherentists avoid regress by requiring only that reasons cohere with each other in a reflective equilibrium. But this seems too weak—a coherent system of evil beliefs (the Nazi's worldview) satisfies coherentism without being justified.

Korsgaard's solution is different. Reasons are grounded not in external foundations but in the structure of agency itself. To be a rational agent at all requires treating certain things as reasons. The normativity is internal to agency, not derived from independent metaphysical facts.

### 5.2.3 The Practical Identity

Korsgaard introduces the concept of **practical identity**: "a description under which you find your life to be worth living and your actions to be worth undertaking" (*Self-Constitution*, 19).

Examples:
- I am a parent (this identity gives me reasons: my child's wellbeing matters)
- I am a scientist (this identity gives me reasons: truth-seeking matters)
- I am a citizen (this identity gives me reasons: justice matters)

These identities are not mere descriptions. They are normative commitments that generate reasons for action. When I am parent, my child's suffering is not mere fact but something that *demands* response. The identity constitutes me as agent for whom certain considerations count as reasons.

Crucially, practical identities are *chosen* (though often implicitly, through action rather than explicit decision). I adopt identity of parent through choosing to have children and committing to their care. The identity is not given by biology (merely reproducing does not make one parent in the normative sense) but constituted through commitment.

### 5.2.4 The Coherence Requirement

Here is Korsgaard's key move: Not all practical identities are coherent or sustainable. Some identities undermine the possibility of agency itself.

Consider the identity "I am a liar." If I constitute myself as liar, I undermine the possibility of communication—for why should anyone believe me? If I say "I will do X," you know I'm lying, so my utterance cannot function as promise. The identity defeats itself.

Or consider "I am purely selfish being who recognizes no obligations." This identity undermines the possibility of practical reasoning. If I recognize no obligations, I cannot take anything as genuinely normative reason—only as desire or preference. But practical reasoning requires treating some considerations as *reasons* (having normative force), not mere desires.

The point generalizes: Some practical identities are self-undermining. They cannot be coherently maintained because they undermine the conditions of agency itself.

### 5.2.5 The Self-Constitution Thesis

This generates Korsgaard's central thesis: **Acting constitutes the agent, and only some self-constitutions are possible.**

When I act on reasons emerging from practical identity, I constitute myself as agent of that kind. The actions are not external to identity; they *make* me what I am. As Aristotle said, "We become just by performing just acts" (*Nicomachean Ethics*, 1103a-b).

But I cannot constitute myself as just anything. Some self-constitutions are incoherent (the liar), some are unsustainable (the purely selfish being), some undermine agency itself.

Ethics emerges from the requirements of coherent self-constitution. I am not bound by cosmic law but by the practical requirements of maintaining coherent agency over time.

## 5.3 The Emergence of Normativity

How does this solve the bootstrapping problem? By showing that normativity emerges from the structure of agency itself, not from external foundations.


## 5.2.0 Self-Constitution Under the Absurd

Before developing the technical account of how practical identities generate normativity, we must be clear about the background conditions: self-constitution does not happen in metaphysical vacuum. It happens under Absurdist constraints—against the silence, within mortality, amid contingency, without cosmic validation.

This matters enormously. Korsgaard's framework, as typically presented, proceeds as if the metaphysical background were neutral or favorable. You constitute yourself as parent, scientist, citizen—and these identities straightforwardly generate reasons. But Camus forces us to acknowledge: the universe does not endorse these identities. There is no cosmic script calling you to be parent, no natural teleology making science sacred, no divine plan requiring citizenship. You constitute yourself as these things *despite* the universe's complete indifference.

This transforms self-constitution from comfortable philosophical mechanism into existential act of defiance.

**The tragic dimension**: Every practical identity adopted under Absurdist conditions is a wager. When I constitute myself as parent, I generate reasons (my child's wellbeing matters) without cosmic warranty. The universe does not mark my child's suffering as objectively bad, does not guarantee my parenting will succeed, does not validate the identity as "correct" or "good." I simply *make* these things matter through my commitment—knowing the commitment has no backing beyond its own coherence and sustainability.

This is more honest than traditional ethics. Pre-Absurdist frameworks could appeal to God ("I am parent because God commands procreation"), nature ("I am parent fulfilling biological teleology"), or cosmic order ("I am parent contributing to species continuance, which has objective value"). These supports have collapsed. Under Absurdist conditions, I cannot point beyond myself to justify my practical identities. They must stand on their own or not at all.

**But this makes the identities more demanding, not less**. A practical identity that cannot be sustained when you fully acknowledge the Absurd—when you recognize your mortality, accept contingency, embrace the silence—is a weak identity, one requiring self-deception to maintain. The identities that *can* be sustained under these conditions have been tested against the hardest truths we know. They are existentially verified, not cosmically validated.

**The craftsman example**: Consider the craftsman who finds meaning in his work. Pre-Absurdist justification: "Craftsmanship serves God," or "Craft develops human nature toward its telos," or "Quality work contributes to cosmic order." All false or unjustified.

Absurdist justification: "I constitute myself as craftsman. This identity engages my capacities, connects me to tradition and others, generates reasons for action (excellence matters, quality matters), sustains itself through time without requiring false beliefs. When I confront my mortality, contingency, and the universe's indifference, this identity *still holds*. Not because the universe endorses it, but because it remains coherent under full consciousness of my condition."

This is a different kind of justification—harder-won, more fragile, but also more honest. The craftsman does not pretend his work has cosmic significance. He recognizes it has *human* significance—significance generated through his self-constitution and sustained despite (not because of) reality's structure.

**Why this matters for what follows**: The technical machinery of self-constitution theory (practical identities, coherence requirements, recognition) now operates in specific context. We are not asking generally "What makes agency coherent?" We are asking specifically: "What makes agency coherent for beings who are:
- Mortal (no infinite time to realize projects)
- Contingent (subject to arbitrary fortune)
- Meaning-seeking without cosmic validation (must generate rather than discover reasons)
- Social without transcendent foundation for obligations (cannot appeal to God-given dignity)"

These Absurdist constraints *strengthen* rather than weaken the framework. They rule out practical identities that work only through self-deception (requiring belief in eternal life, cosmic justice, guaranteed success, divine backing). They test identities against harsh reality: Can you maintain this identity while fully conscious of your condition? Does it collapse when confronted with mortality? Does it require denying contingency? Does it survive the silence?

The practical identities that pass this test are the ones worth adopting. Not because they make you happy (though they might), not because society approves (though it might), not because they're cosmically correct (they aren't)—but because they can be sustained by beings like us, in conditions like ours, without lying to ourselves about what we are or where we are.

**This is agency as defiance, not agency as comfort**. Every deliberation happens against awareness that nothing ultimately matters. Every practical identity is adopted knowing the universe will not care whether I maintain it. Every commitment is made despite, not because of, the metaphysical facts. This is not the agency Korsgaard typically describes—rational beings calmly constituting themselves in philosophical seminar rooms. This is agency under siege, constituting meaning in a void that offers no encouragement.

But it is *possible*. And that is what needs to be shown. Not that self-constitution is easy or comfortable, but that it can be done—that practical identities can be coherently adopted and sustained even (especially) by beings who know the truth about their condition. The remainder of this chapter provides the machinery. But we now understand the conditions under which that machinery operates: not in metaphysical neutrality, but in defiance of metaphysical silence.

### 5.2.1 The Source of Obligation

When I constitute myself as parent, I bind myself to parental reasons. My child's wellbeing becomes genuinely normative for me—it *ought* to move me to action, not merely as preference but as obligation.

The obligation is not cosmically grounded. There is no transcendent fact making parenthood obligatory. But neither is it arbitrary. It is binding because:

1. I chose the practical identity (implicitly or explicitly)
2. The identity constitutes who I am as agent
3. The reasons flow from the identity's internal logic
4. Abandoning the identity would require becoming different agent

This is real obligation, not mere preference. I cannot simply decide parental obligations don't bind me without ceasing to be parent—which requires fundamental transformation of identity, not casual choice.

### 5.2.2 The Nazi Objection

Objection: Doesn't this allow the Nazi to constitute themselves as "Aryan warrior" and thereby generate "obligations" to persecute Jews?

No. The Nazi identity fails because it embodies a logical contradiction at the heart of agency itself.

**The structural problem**: The Nazi claims agency for themselves—they deliberate, make commitments, demand recognition of their practical identity. But they simultaneously deny agency to others, treating Jews as mere obstacles rather than as beings with their own standpoint, reasons, and capacity for practical identity.

This is not merely morally problematic—it is structurally incoherent. To be an agent at all requires the capacity to recognize agency: when I deliberate, I implicitly treat my reasons as the kind of thing that could be shared, defended, explained to others. This presupposes those others are rational beings capable of evaluating reasons. The Nazi identity requires *using* this capacity (to constitute themselves as agents) while *denying* it in others (to justify domination).

You cannot coherently claim: "I am a being whose practical reasoning generates genuine reasons for action, but they are not such beings." The capacity you invoke for yourself is either the kind of thing that generates reasons or it isn't. If it is, it generates reasons in all who possess it. If it isn't, your own practical identity has no normative force.

Moreover, the Nazi identity fails pragmatically under the Sustainability Test. Chapter 10 (Section 10.3.3a) provides the complete thermodynamic argument: identities requiring systematic denial of observable reality consume unbounded energy—fighting accumulating counterevidence is entropically expensive. The Nazi identity could only be maintained through escalating violence, propaganda, and self-deception, ultimately collapsing under its own energetic requirements. This is paradigm case of an identity doomed by physical constraint, not merely moral principle.

This is enough for present purposes: to show that self-constitution theory is constrained by recognition requirements, not open to arbitrary identities. The Nazi objection fails not because we stipulate it away but because the identity is structurally unsustainable.

### 5.4.4 The Practical Constraint

I add to Korsgaard's framework a pragmatist element: practical identities are tested by their consequences for agency and human flourishing.

A practical identity is problematic if it:
- Undermines the agent's own capacity for agency (addiction, self-destruction)
- Undermines others' agency (domination, violence, deception)
- Cannot be sustained through changing circumstances (too rigid)
- Produces systematic suffering without compensating goods
- Requires false beliefs to maintain
- Cannot survive rational reflection

These are empirical tests, not a priori principles. We discover through experience which identities are sustainable, which undermine agency, which produce flourishing or suffering.

This pragmatist addition addresses a weakness in Korsgaard: her framework is sometimes too formal, too divorced from consequences. By adding pragmatist tests, we ensure practical identities are constrained not only by coherence but by livability.

## 5.4 Resolving the Bootstrapping Problem

Return now to Camus's ethical bootstrapping problem: How can we derive normative conclusions from purely descriptive premises about meaninglessness?

The self-constitution framework shows the question is misconceived. We do not derive ethics from metaphysical premises. We ground ethics in the structure of rational agency itself.

### 5.4.1 The Solution

**Premise 1**: I am a rational agent (I deliberate and act on reasons)

**Premise 2**: To act, I must constitute myself as having particular practical identity

**Premise 3**: Only certain practical identities are coherent and sustainable

**Premise 4**: Coherent practical identities involve recognition of others' agency and constraints on action

**Conclusion**: Therefore, I have obligations—not cosmically grounded, but grounded in requirements of coherent agency

This argument does not derive "ought" from "is." It shows that oughts are internal to the practice of rational agency. If I am agent at all, I am already subject to normative constraints.

### 5.4.2 Why This Avoids Arbitrariness

The obligations are not arbitrary because they are constrained by:
- The structure of rational agency (coherence requirements)
- Social nature of selfhood (recognition of others)
- Empirical facts about human flourishing (pragmatic tests)
- Deliberative process of reflective equilibrium

Different agents in different situations will develop different practical identities—but not arbitrarily. The identities emerge from situated deliberation about how to live given one's talents, relationships, values, and circumstances.

### 5.5.3 Why This Avoids Transcendence

The obligations do not require cosmic grounding because they are not claims about universe's values. They are claims about requirements of coherent agency.

When I say "I ought to care for my child," I am not asserting transcendent moral fact. I am expressing commitment constitutive of my identity as parent—commitment that binds me because abandoning it would require becoming different agent, which is possible but not trivial.

The normativity is real but not transcendent. It is binding but not cosmically validated. This is what ethics after absurdism looks like.

## 5.5 Practical Identities and Meaning

The self-constitution framework also addresses the meaning question. Meaningful life involves coherent practical identities that engage one's capacities and connect one to others.

### 5.5.1 The Fitting Fulfillment Reconceived

Recall Susan Wolf's view: meaning requires subjective fulfillment *plus* objective attractiveness. The problem was grounding "objective attractiveness" without transcendence.

Self-constitution framework provides the grounding. A project is "objectively attractive" (or better: "worth pursuing") if:
- It emerges from coherent practical identity
- It develops genuine capacities
- It connects agent to others in recognizing ways
- It survives reflective scrutiny
- It contributes to rather than undermines human flourishing (pragmatic test)

These criteria are not cosmically validated but they are not arbitrary. They constrain which projects can constitute meaningful life.

### 5.5.2 The Sadist Revisited

Wolf's paradigm case of meaningless life was the sadist who finds torture fulfilling. Why does this lack meaning?

Self-constitution answer: The sadist identity is incoherent. It requires refusing to recognize victims' agency (treating them as mere objects for one's pleasure). But agency requires capacity for recognition of others. The sadist must simultaneously possess agency (to deliberate about torture) and deny it (refuse recognition of victims). This is self-undermining.

Moreover, the sadist identity cannot survive reflective scrutiny. Once the sadist genuinely imagines being in the victim's position—exercises the capacity for perspective-taking that agency requires—the identity collapses. It can only be maintained through willful refusal of reflection.

Finally, pragmatically the sadist identity produces suffering without compensating goods and requires social structures (secrecy, power imbalance) that undermine trust and cooperation.

### 5.5.3 Meaning Without Cosmic Purpose

I can live meaningful life through:
- Developing practical identities that engage my capacities (parent, teacher, artist, activist)
- Pursuing projects emerging from these identities
- Connecting with others through recognition of shared agency
- Contributing to human flourishing
- Maintaining coherence through reflective equilibrium

None of this requires cosmic purpose. The meaning is real—these projects and relationships genuinely matter, generate reasons for action, constitute who I am. But it is human meaning, grounded in human agency, not cosmic significance.

This is meaning after absurdism: meaning that survives the collapse of transcendent frameworks by being grounded in practical rationality rather than metaphysical foundations.

## 5.6 The Pragmatist Addition

Korsgaard's framework is powerful but incomplete. It is too formalist—focused on coherence and rational structure while insufficiently attentive to consequences and empirical constraints. I supplement it with pragmatist epistemology.

### 5.6.1 Values Are Tested, Not Derived

Pragmatism's central insight: we do not derive values from first principles; we test them through experience and revise based on consequences.

A practical identity is not validated by deduction from metaphysical premises. It is tested by:
- Does it enable flourishing over time?
- Does it sustain agency through challenges?
- Does it produce suffering for agent or others?
- Can it survive reflective scrutiny and social criticism?
- Does it adapt to changing circumstances?

These are empirical questions requiring ongoing inquiry, not a priori truths derived once and for all.

### 5.6.2 Fallibilism

Pragmatism is fallibilist: our value commitments are always revisable in light of experience. I might discover that practical identity I adopted is unsustainable, produces suffering, or rests on false beliefs. I must then revise.

This fallibilism applies even to seemingly fundamental commitments. I might discover that my conception of parenthood is too controlling, my professional identity too consuming, my political commitments too rigid. Growth involves revising practical identities in light of experience.

This may seem to undermine normativity—if all values are revisable, are any binding? But revisability does not imply arbitrariness. Values bind *now* while remaining open to revision *later* through deliberation. This is how rational belief works in all domains.

### 5.6.3 The Community of Inquiry

Values are tested not only individually but socially. I discover which practical identities are sustainable partly through observing others, learning from tradition, engaging in moral conversation.

This is not relativism—not "values are whatever my community says." It is social epistemology: we learn about values through collective inquiry, much as we learn about natural world through collective scientific investigation.

Just as individual scientist can be wrong while scientific community converges on truth over time, individual agent can be confused about values while community of inquiry progresses morally. This explains moral progress without requiring transcendent standards.

### 5.6.4 Integration With Self-Constitution

The pragmatist addition strengthens Korsgaard's framework:

**Korsgaard provides**: The structure showing how normativity emerges from agency itself

**Pragmatism provides**: The methodology for testing which practical identities are sustainable

Together they show: Ethics emerges from requirements of coherent agency (Korsgaard) and is refined through experience and collective inquiry (pragmatism). This combination grounds values without either transcendence or arbitrariness.

## 5.7 Remaining Objections

### 5.6.1 "This Still Requires A Choice"

Objection: Even if coherent agency requires certain practical identities, I must still *choose* to be coherent agent. Why not embrace incoherence?

Response: This objection is incoherent. To deliberate about whether to be agent is already to be agent. I cannot step outside agency to evaluate it from neutral standpoint. The demand for justification of agency itself is confused.

As Korsgaard argues, agency is not hypothesis requiring justification but standpoint from which justification proceeds. The question "Why be rational?" cannot be answered because asking it presupposes rationality.

### 5.7.2 "You're Smuggling In Kantianism"

Objection: This framework is just Kantian ethics disguised. You're deriving morality from practical reason, which is what Kant did.

Response: There are important differences:

- **Kant**: Derived universal moral law from pure practical reason alone
- **This framework**: Shows obligations emerge from practical identities, which vary by agent and situation

- **Kant**: Categorical imperative is a priori truth binding all rational beings
- **This framework**: Obligations emerge from situated agency and are tested empirically

- **Kant**: Noumenal self transcends empirical nature
- **This framework**: Naturalist—agency is biological and social phenomenon

The resemblance is real (both ground ethics in practical reason rather than metaphysics), but the differences are substantial.

### 5.7.3 "Some Practical Identities Still Seem Problematic"

Objection: What about the identity "I am warrior" or "I am devoted to nation above all"? These seem coherent and sustainable but potentially dangerous.

Response: These identities are not automatically problematic. Warrior identity can be coherent if constrained by recognition of others' humanity (just war theory). National devotion can be coherent if balanced with cosmopolitan recognition.

The identities become problematic when they require denying others' agency (warrior who sees enemies as subhuman) or produce systematic suffering without compensating goods (nationalism that leads to genocide).

These are empirical questions. We test practical identities by their consequences. Some identities we might initially think coherent turn out to undermine agency or produce suffering. We learn through experience.

### 5.7.4 "This Doesn't Help Someone In Crisis"

Objection: Someone experiencing existential crisis—unable to find meaning, paralyzed by absurdity—will not be helped by abstract philosophy about self-constitution.

Response: Partially true. Someone in acute crisis may need therapeutic intervention, not philosophy. But for those capable of philosophical engagement, this framework provides guidance:

1. Identify your practical identities (even minimal ones: "I am person who values honesty")
2. Ask which identities are sustainable and coherent
3. Consider which identities engage your capacities
4. Recognize that commitments emerging from practical identities can bind without cosmic validation
5. Accept that meaning is human meaning—this is sufficient

This is more helpful than Camus's prescription (maintain tension without resolution) or Sartre's (choose authentically from total possibility). It provides structure for deliberation while avoiding both transcendence and arbitrariness.

## 5.8 Transition to Social Constitution

This chapter has shown how ethics emerges from the structure of individual agency. But this is incomplete. Agency is always already social—constituted through relationships, embedded in practices, responsive to others.

Chapter 6 develops the social dimension, showing that practical identities are not individually created but socially constituted. This moves beyond both Camus's individualism and Sartre's conflictual account of social relations. It also provides foundation for political philosophy that absurdism lacked.

The key insight: meaning is never purely individual. We become agents through relationships, develop practical identities within communities, test values through social inquiry. The self-constitution framework must be socialized.

But the preliminary work is complete. We have shown that:
- Normativity emerges from requirements of coherent agency (not cosmic foundations)
- Practical identities generate binding obligations (without transcendence)
- Values are tested pragmatically (not derived a priori)
- Meaning is possible without cosmic purpose (as coherent engagement of capacities)

This solves the ethical bootstrapping problem. Ethics without foundations is possible because ethics is not founded on metaphysics but on the structure of practical rationality itself. Now we must show how that structure is inherently social.
