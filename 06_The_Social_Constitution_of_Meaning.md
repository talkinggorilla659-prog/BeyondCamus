# Chapter 6: The Social Constitution of Meaning

Chapter 5 showed how normativity emerges from individual agency. But this account is incomplete. There is no purely individual agency—selfhood is socially constituted from the ground up. Practical identities are not created ex nihilo by isolated consciousness but developed within communities of practice. Values are not individually constructed but socially negotiated and collectively refined.

This chapter completes the foundation of pragmatic existentialism by showing that meaning is inherently social. This moves beyond Camus's and Sartre's excessive individualism, provides basis for political philosophy, and shows how values can be both constructed (not transcendent) and binding (not arbitrary).

## 6.1 The Social Constitution of Self

### 6.1.1 Against Individualism

Both Camus and Sartre begin with individual consciousness confronting the world. For Camus, the absurd is experienced by individual who then revolts. For Sartre, consciousness creates values through individual choice. Both privilege the individual over the social.

This is phenomenologically false. I do not first exist as individual consciousness and then subsequently encounter society. I am always already social. My language, concepts, values, and self-understanding are inherited from communities I am born into.

As Hegel recognized, selfhood requires recognition from others. I become self-conscious agent through being recognized as such by other agents (*Phenomenology of Spirit*, §178-196). An isolated consciousness could not develop agency—it would lack concepts, language, and practical identities through which agency operates.

### 6.1.2 Learning Practical Identities

Practical identities are not invented individually but learned socially. I become parent by internalizing cultural scripts about parenthood—expectations, norms, role models. I become professional by entering community of practice with established standards. I become citizen by inhabiting political community with shared institutions.

This is not passive socialization erasing autonomy. It is condition of possibility for agency. Without social templates, I could not know what it means to be parent, professional, or citizen. The templates provide starting points I can then critically appropriate or modify.

Mature agency involves inheriting social identities while retaining capacity for critical reflection. I adopt cultural understanding of parenthood but adapt it to my circumstances. I enter professional community but may challenge its norms. I inhabit citizenship but work for institutional reform.

### 6.1.3 Language and Value

Language is paradigm case of social constitution. I do not create my language individually. I learn it from others, and its meanings are sustained through collective usage.

Values work similarly. Terms like "justice," "compassion," "integrity" derive meaning from shared practices. I learn what counts as just action by observing how my community uses the concept—paradigm cases, disputed borderlines, practical applications.

I can critique my community's conception of justice—but only using resources the language itself provides. I cannot step outside language to evaluate it from nowhere. All critique is internal to shared practices.

### 6.1.4 Implications for Self-Constitution

This socializes Korsgaard's self-constitution framework. Practical identities are not created by isolated consciousness but appropriated from social world. The coherence constraints on practical identities are partly social—some identities cannot be sustained within particular communities.

Moreover, the recognition of others' agency (which Korsgaard argues is constitutive of agency itself) is not merely logical requirement but social reality. I learn to recognize others through being recognized by them. Mutual recognition is foundation of social existence.

## 6.2 Communities of Practice

### 6.2.1 MacIntyre's Contribution

Alasdair MacIntyre argued that virtues and values are internal to practices—cooperative activities with standards of excellence and internal goods (*After Virtue*, 187-191). One cannot understand courage without understanding practices (warfare, dangerous rescue) where courage is exercised. One cannot grasp intellectual virtues without participating in inquiry.

This captures important truth: values are embedded in forms of life, not floating abstractions. I learn what counts as good teaching by participating in educational practice. I learn good citizenship through political engagement. Abstract philosophical reflection on values is secondary to practical participation.

### 6.2.2 Practices Constitute Agency

Practices are not optional additions to pre-existing agency. They constitute the agent. I become teacher through entering educational practice, internalizing its standards, developing relevant virtues. The practice shapes my perception, deliberation, and action.

This is deeper than Sartre's picture of consciousness freely choosing among pre-existing options. The options themselves—available practical identities—emerge from practices. I cannot choose to be "quantum physicist" unless that practice exists with its standards, methods, and community.

### 6.2.3 Internal vs. External Goods

MacIntyre distinguishes "internal goods" (achievable only through practice—e.g., mathematical understanding, athletic excellence) from "external goods" (achievable through various means—e.g., money, fame).

Meaning comes primarily from internal goods. I find meaning in teaching when I appreciate the internal goods of education—student flourishing, knowledge transmission, intellectual growth. If I teach only for salary (external good), I may lack meaning despite objective success.

This explains why some objectively successful lives feel meaningless: they pursue external goods without engaging internal goods of practices. The self-constitution framework needs this addition—practical identities provide meaning when they engage internal goods of practices, not merely when they are coherent.

### 6.2.4 The Fragility of Practices

Practices can be corrupted or destroyed. When educational institutions prioritize metrics over learning, teaching practice is corrupted. When scientific institutions prioritize funding over truth, inquiry suffers. When political life becomes purely instrumental, citizenship loses meaning.

This introduces vulnerability absent from Korsgaard's more abstract framework. My practical identities depend on social practices that I do not fully control. If practices erode, my sources of meaning are threatened.

This is neither transcendence nor arbitrariness—it is situated normativity. Values are real (grounded in practices) but fragile (dependent on social sustainability).

## 6.3 Democratic Deliberation

### 6.3.1 Beyond Individualism

If values are socially constituted, how are they determined? Not by individual fiat (Sartre) and not by tradition alone (MacIntyre's conservatism). Through democratic deliberation—collective inquiry into how we should live together.

This is pragmatism's contribution. Values emerge from experimental social practices, are tested by consequences, and are revised through collective deliberation. No individual or tradition has final authority. We learn together through experience.

### 6.3.2 The Deliberative Ideal

Ideal deliberation involves:
- **Inclusion**: All affected parties participate
- **Reciprocity**: Reasons offered must be shareable
- **Publicity**: Deliberation occurs openly
- **Revisability**: Conclusions can be revisited
- **Equality**: All voices have equal standing

This ideal is never fully realized but provides regulative standard. We criticize actual deliberation by its distance from this ideal.

### 6.3.3 Grounding Political Obligation

This framework grounds political obligation without transcendence. I am obligated to democratic institutions because:
- I am constituted as agent through social practices
- Practices require coordination and sustainability
- Democratic deliberation is best method for coordinating while respecting agency
- Opting out would undermine conditions of my own agency

This is not social contract (fictional agreement) or utilitarianism (aggregate welfare). It is recognition that agency is socially constituted and therefore involves obligations to sustain social conditions of agency.

### 6.3.4 The Authority of Democracy

Why privilege democratic deliberation over other forms of collective decision-making (tradition, authority, expertise)?

Because democracy uniquely respects agency of all participants. Authoritarian systems treat some as mere objects of governance. Theocracy appeals to transcendent authority unavailable to reason. Technocracy privileges expertise over citizens' reflective endorsement.

Democracy treats all citizens as agents capable of deliberation about shared life. This is not empirical claim (citizens are always wise) but normative commitment flowing from social constitution of agency.

## 6.4 Social Justice and Oppression

### 6.4.1 The Oppression Problem

Oppression is not merely harm—it is denial of agency. When systems treat people as less than full agents (through slavery, patriarchy, colonialism, economic exploitation), they violate the social conditions that make agency possible.

This grounds opposition to oppression without transcendence. Oppression is wrong not because cosmic law forbids it but because it undermines the social constitution of agency—for both oppressed and oppressor.

### 6.4.2 The Symmetry Objection

Recall Camus's failure to distinguish oppressor's violence from oppressed's resistance. Both use force; neither is cosmically validated.

Social constitution provides the distinction. The oppressed resist to restore conditions of agency. The oppressor uses force to deny agency. These are not symmetrical.

When enslaved person revolts, they seek recognition as agent—something oppressive system denies. When master enforces slavery, they refuse recognition. The first restores social constitution of agency; the second violates it.

### 6.4.3 Solidarity Grounded

This grounds Camus's intuition about solidarity without his bootstrapping problem. We are obligated to oppose oppression because:
- Agency is socially constituted
- Oppression undermines social conditions of agency
- Therefore opposing oppression sustains conditions of our own agency

This is not merely self-interest (oppression might benefit me personally). It is recognition that my agency depends on social practices that grant agency to all. To accept some people's exclusion is to undermine the grounds of my own agency.

### 6.4.4 The Limits of Violence

Does this justify any resistance, including violence? No—for two reasons:

**First**, violence against persons treats them as mere objects, refusing recognition. It should be last resort when agency cannot be restored through other means.

**Second**, pragmatically, violence often produces more suffering than it alleviates and can corrupt the practices it aims to protect. We have empirical reasons to prefer nonviolent resistance where effective.

But sometimes oppression is so entrenched that nonviolent resistance is ineffective. In such cases, limited violence to restore conditions of agency can be justified—not because cosmic law permits it, but because the alternative (continued oppression) is worse for agency overall.

This is tragic. Unlike Camus's abstract revolt that maintains purity, real resistance involves moral remainder—justified actions that still cause harm. This is what political life looks like without transcendence.

## 6.5 Resolving Absurdism's Political Failures

### 6.5.1 The Commitment Problem Resolved

Camus could not ground sustained political commitment. Maintaining consciousness of absurdity while fighting oppression was psychologically exhausting.

Social constitution resolves this. I commit to justice not despite meaninglessness but because justice sustains social conditions of meaning. The commitment is not arbitrary preference but follows from my situated agency.

I can fully invest in political struggle without hope for cosmic vindication. The struggle itself—working with others to expand agency—is meaningful because it emerges from practical identities (citizen, activist) that constitute who I am.

### 6.5.2 The Certainty Problem Resolved

Political action often requires conviction one doesn't fully possess. How can I act decisively while acknowledging uncertainty?

Social constitution provides answer. I deliberate with others, reach provisional conclusions, act on them while remaining open to revision. This is not paralyzing uncertainty (Camus's lucidity) or arbitrary certainty (Sartre's radical choice). It is reasonable confidence appropriate to fallible beings.

I act with conviction because (a) I have deliberated carefully, (b) my community has reached provisional consensus, (c) the consequences are pressing, and (d) I accept responsibility for being wrong. This is sufficient for action without requiring cosmic validation.

### 6.5.3 The Sartre-Camus Debate Resolved

Sartre criticized Camus for maintaining purity at expense of effectiveness. Camus criticized Sartre for justifying violence through historical necessity. Both were wrong.

Pragmatic existentialism avoids both errors. Like Sartre, it supports committed political action even when morally ambiguous. Like Camus, it recognizes limits—violence requires justification, cannot appeal to historical destiny, remains tragic even when necessary.

The difference: pragmatic existentialism has theoretical resources to make these distinctions. It can ground opposition to oppression, justify limited violence, maintain moral limits—all without transcendence.

## 6.6 Meaning in Social Context

### 6.6.1 Individual and Social Meaning

Meaningful life requires both individual practical identities and social practices sustaining them. I find meaning in parenting (individual identity) within community that values and supports childrearing (social practice).

When practices erode—when society fails to support parents, education, art, inquiry—individual meaning is threatened. This is why cultural criticism matters. We must sustain practices that enable meaning.

### 6.6.2 The Meaning Crisis Revisited

Contemporary meaning crisis partly reflects erosion of practices. Market logic colonizes domains previously governed by internal goods. Education becomes credential-seeking, medicine becomes business, art becomes commodity, citizenship becomes consumer choice.

When practices are corrupted, internal goods become inaccessible. People work without meaning, consume without satisfaction, succeed without flourishing. The crisis is not primarily philosophical confusion but social-structural erosion of meaning-sustaining practices.

### 6.6.3 The Response

Responding requires:
- **Individual level**: Choosing practical identities oriented to internal goods
- **Community level**: Building or sustaining practices that enable meaning
- **Political level**: Resisting corruption of practices, supporting institutions that sustain them

This is more concrete than Camus's revolt. It provides practical guidance for responding to meaninglessness in late modernity.

### 6.6.4 Is Recognition Universal or Western? A Critical Examination

The objection looms: "You claim recognition of all persons as equal moral agents is constitutive of rational agency. But this is historically recent, culturally Western idea. Most human societies have maintained hierarchies—caste, gender, age, ethnicity. Aren't you imposing liberal egalitarianism as universal truth?"

This is the most serious challenge to the framework. It deserves extended, honest response.

#### The Historical Facts

The objection is correct about history. Equal moral status for all persons is not human universal:

**Historical norm**: Most societies have recognized differential moral status:
- Ancient Greece: Citizens vs. slaves, men vs. women, Greeks vs. barbarians
- Medieval Europe: Nobility, clergy, peasantry with different rights and obligations
- Hindu tradition: Caste system with differentiated dharma
- Confucian societies: Five relationships with hierarchical obligations
- Islamic societies: Believers vs. dhimmi with different legal status
- Pre-modern everywhere: Adults vs. children, men vs. women, free vs. enslaved

**Recent development**: Idea that all humans have equal basic moral status emerges primarily from:
- Enlightenment philosophy (Kant, Rousseau, Locke)
- Christian egalitarianism (all equal before God)
- Liberal political revolutions (American, French)
- Post-WWII human rights frameworks

This egalitarianism is **historically anomalous**, not anthropological constant. The objector is right to be suspicious.

#### The Honest Acknowledgment

I must concede: **My framework presumes egalitarian intuitions that are culturally Western and historically recent.**

When I argue (Chapter 5) that rational agency requires equal recognition, I'm not deriving this from pure practical reason. I'm working within tradition that already values equality and showing how that value can be grounded non-transcendently.

Someone from hierarchical tradition could use my framework's structure (practical identities, social constitution, pragmatic testing) while reaching different conclusions about recognition. A sophisticated Confucian could say:

*"Yes, practical identities are socially constituted and tested pragmatically. My tradition has sustained coherent social life for millennia through differentiated recognition—junzi and xiaoren, elder and younger, ruler and subject. This works. Your egalitarianism is recent experiment whose long-term viability is unproven."*

I cannot dismiss this from pure philosophy. So what's my response?

#### The Pragmatic Defense (Not Transcendental)

I abandon the transcendental argument (equal recognition follows necessarily from practical reason) in favor of pragmatic argument (equal recognition works better).

**The claim**: Societies organized around equal recognition of all persons as moral agents produce better outcomes than hierarchical alternatives—measured by:
- Human flourishing (health, longevity, capabilities)
- Social stability (less violent conflict)
- Innovation (more creativity and problem-solving)
- Adaptability (responding to changing conditions)
- Sustainability (maintaining social order without excessive repression)

**The evidence**:

1. **Economic development**: Societies that extend equal legal and political status to all citizens (regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion) consistently outperform those that don't. This is not mere correlation—exclusion wastes human capital.

2. **Social stability**: Hierarchical systems generate resistance requiring constant enforcement. Slavery produced revolts, apartheid generated sustained resistance, gender hierarchies face ongoing challenge. Systems must either reform or increase repression (which corrupts institutions).

3. **Innovation**: Societies that allow social mobility and don't restrict roles by ascribed characteristics produce more innovation. Hierarchies waste talents of excluded groups.

4. **Historical trajectory**: The long-term historical trend—despite setbacks—is toward greater inclusion. Not because of moral progress in abstract sense but because more inclusive systems outcompete less inclusive ones.

5. **Comparative institutions**: When societies reform toward equal recognition (abolishing slavery, extending suffrage, equalizing legal rights), they don't collapse—they strengthen. When societies impose hierarchies, they typically require external force or eventually liberalize.

**The key point**: This is empirical argument, not a priori deduction. It's falsifiable. If hierarchical societies consistently outperformed egalitarian ones, this would challenge my framework.

#### Why Hierarchical Systems Fail Pragmatically

The mechanism is straightforward:

**Problem 1—Wasted capacity**: When you deny education, political participation, or economic opportunity to half your population (women) or large segments (lower castes), you lose their potential contributions. This is pragmatic loss, not just moral failing.

**Problem 2—Justified resistance**: People are rational agents who recognize when they're treated as less than full moral persons. They resist. Hierarchical systems must constantly suppress resistance, which is costly and corrupting.

**Problem 3—Arbitrary boundaries**: Hierarchies must draw lines (who counts as full citizen? full person?). But the lines are arbitrary—based on characteristics (race, gender, birth) that don't track morally relevant capacities. This arbitrariness becomes obvious upon reflection, undermining the hierarchy's legitimacy.

**Problem 4—Internal contradictions**: Most hierarchies are internally inconsistent. They recognize some people as capable of reason, moral judgment, self-governance while denying these capacities to others who demonstrably possess them. This can't be sustained through honest reflection.

**Problem 5—Vulnerability**: Hierarchical systems are vulnerable to external pressure and internal reform movements. Over time, they either liberalize or become isolated (see: apartheid South Africa, Saudi Arabia's gradual reforms).

#### The Sophisticated Hierarchist's Response

A defender of hierarchy might say: "You're just saying modern Western systems win because they're currently dominant. This is might-makes-right dressed as pragmatism."

**My response**:

**First**, I'm not claiming dominance proves rightness. I'm claiming that when societies face genuine choice between systems (not external imposition), they trend toward greater equality. This suggests egalitarian systems better satisfy human needs.

**Second**, the mechanisms aren't arbitrary. More inclusive systems work better for identifiable reasons (utilizing more talent, generating less resistance, proving more adaptable).

**Third**, I can point to failures of imposed hierarchy. Colonial hierarchies required massive violence to maintain and collapsed when force was withdrawn. This isn't just "the powerful lost"—it's "systems requiring constant repression are unsustainable."

**Fourth**, internal reform movements arise even in isolated hierarchical societies (Indian caste reform, women's movements in conservative societies). This suggests egalitarian impulses aren't purely Western imports but responses to experienced injustice.

#### What About Functional Hierarchies?

Important distinction: Not all differentiation is problematic hierarchy.

**Compatible with equal recognition**:
- **Role-based authority**: Parents over children, teachers over students, experts in their domains
- **Earned status**: Leaders selected for competence, meritocratic advancement
- **Specialized function**: Different people excel at different activities
- **Legitimate governance**: Democratic authority exercised through consent

These involve differentiation but not denial of equal moral status. The child is recognized as developing agent, the student as learner becoming teacher, the citizen as source of legitimate authority.

**Incompatible with equal recognition**:
- **Categorical subordination**: Entire groups denied full moral status based on immutable characteristics
- **Inherited hierarchy**: Status determined by birth, unchangeable regardless of capacity
- **Unchallenged authority**: Those in power cannot be questioned or held accountable
- **Denial of basic capacities**: Some people treated as incapable of reason, self-governance, moral judgment despite demonstrating these capacities

The Confucian might argue their system involves the first kind (functional) not the second (categorical). This requires examination of actual practice: Can the xiaoren become junzi through cultivation? Can subjects challenge rulers? Can women and men switch roles? If yes, it's functional differentiation. If no, it's categorical hierarchy that pragmatically fails.

#### The Moral Progress Question

Does this mean moral progress is real? Yes and no.

**Yes** in pragmatic sense: We learn through experience which social arrangements enable flourishing and which produce suffering. Abolition of slavery, extension of rights to women, recognition of LGBTQ persons—these represent learning, not arbitrary change.

**No** in transcendent sense: I'm not claiming these norms were "always true but unrecognized." I'm claiming we discover through experience that equal recognition works better than alternatives.

This is progress like scientific progress: we learn what works. Not progress like approaching Platonic ideal: we discover eternal truths.

#### The Remaining Tension

I cannot fully resolve tension between:
- **Particularism**: My framework emphasizes situated agency, social constitution, practice-dependence
- **Universalism**: I claim equal recognition should be universal

A fully consistent particularist would say: "Different societies develop different recognition structures. None is privileged." But I resist this because hierarchical structures demonstrably fail pragmatically.

**My position**: Basic structure (agency, practices, meaning) is universal. Equal recognition is not directly entailed by that structure but emerges as best solution when tested pragmatically across diverse contexts.

This is less philosophically neat than claiming equal recognition follows from pure practical reason. But it's more honest about cultural embeddedness while providing grounds for critique that pure particularism lacks.

#### The Upshot for Cross-Cultural Dialogue

This framework enables genuine cross-cultural dialogue about recognition without assuming Western superiority:

**What I claim**: All societies must address how to recognize members as agents. The question is: which recognition structure best enables human flourishing?

**What I don't claim**: Western liberal democracies have achieved ideal recognition. They haven't—racism, inequality, and other failures of recognition persist.

**The methodology**: We compare outcomes of different recognition structures empirically. Which enable flourishing? Which generate suffering? Which are sustainable?

**The openness**: I could be wrong. If evidence showed hierarchical societies consistently produced more flourishing with less suffering, I'd revise. But current evidence suggests the opposite.

This isn't cultural imperialism. It's pragmatic inquiry into what works for human beings with our shared capacities and needs.

### 6.6.5 The Universality Question Revisited

Given the analysis above, return to original question: Is this framework parochial?

**What's universal**:
- Agency requires social practices
- Practices enable meaning
- We test practices by consequences
- Rational agents can evaluate and revise practices

**What's culturally specific**:
- Which practices exist in particular societies
- Which goods are valued
- What recognition structures have developed
- How meanings are constructed

**What's argued pragmatically** (not claimed universally):
- Equal recognition works better than hierarchies
- Evidence supports egalitarian structures
- This is revisable if evidence changes

This allows genuine pluralism about practices and meanings while maintaining critical capacity to evaluate recognition structures by outcomes. Not perfect philosophical solution, but honest acknowledgment of framework's cultural situatedness while showing how it transcends pure relativism.

### 6.6.6 Summary

The social constitution of meaning requires:

**Third**, democratic deliberation itself is not parochial imposition but emerges from taking agency seriously. Any society that recognizes members as agents must, in principle, allow their participation in shaping shared life.

## 6.7 Integration: The Pragmatic Existentialist Framework

Parts I and II have now established the complete framework:

**From absurdism** (Chapter 1): We are meaning-seeking beings in meaningless universe

**Against absurdism** (Chapter 2): But revolt cannot ground ethics; bootstrapping problem is fatal

**Against alternatives** (Chapter 3): Religious return is impossible; Sartre is metaphysically extravagant; analytics lack existential force

**Situated freedom** (Chapter 4): Freedom is always already constrained by biology, history, relationships—and constraint enables rather than limits

**Self-constitution** (Chapter 5): Values emerge from structure of rational agency; practical identities generate binding obligations without transcendence

**Social constitution** (Chapter 6): Agency is social; practices constitute meaning; democratic deliberation grounds political life

This synthesis resolves absurdism's contradictions while preserving its phenomenological insights. We can have:
- Ethics without cosmic grounding (self-constitution)
- Meaning without transcendence (practical identities in social practices)
- Political commitment without certainty (fallibilist deliberation)
- Sustainable living with absurdity (situated rather than radical freedom)

Part III now applies this framework to concrete questions: How do we actually live? What does pragmatic existentialism look like in practice?
